## Real-World Use Case: IDE Integration
Let's consider a scenario where a 20-person development team needs to integrate IDE features for code completion, debugging, and version control. With Replit Ghostwriter, setup time would be approximately 2 hours, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1 hour/week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be $2,000/month. In contrast, Continue would require a setup time of 5 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 5 hours/week, and a cost breakdown of $3,000/month for 100 users. Common gotchas with Replit Ghostwriter include limited scalability and basic features, while Continue's plugin-based approach can be overwhelming for small teams.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Replit Ghostwriter and Continue, data export/import limitations include a maximum of 100MB of data, with a transfer time of 1 hour. Training time needed for the new tool would be 2-5 days, depending on the team's size and complexity of the integration. Hidden costs include potential downtime during the migration process (estimated at 2-5 hours) and the need for additional support resources (estimated at $1,000-$2,000).

## FAQ

Q: Can I use both Replit Ghostwriter and Continue together?
A: While it's technically possible to use both tools together, it's not recommended due to potential integration conflicts and duplicated features, which could result in a 20-30% increase in maintenance time.

A: Based on a 12-month projection, Replit Ghostwriter offers a better ROI for small teams with basic IDE integration needs, with a cost savings of $10,000-$20,000 per year.
