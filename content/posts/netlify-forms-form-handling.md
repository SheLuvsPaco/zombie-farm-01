# Does Netlify Have Forms? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
No backend needed. Netlify provides a built-in form handling feature that allows you to manage form submissions without requiring a separate backend infrastructure, streamlining the process of collecting and storing form data. This feature is particularly useful for static sites, as it eliminates the need for server-side code, reducing the complexity and overhead associated with traditional form handling methods.

## How to Use Forms in Netlify (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the Netlify dashboard and select the site for which you want to enable form handling.
2. Click on the "Settings" icon and then select "Forms" from the menu, where you can configure form settings, including notification preferences and submission storage.
3. Result: Once configured, Netlify will handle form submissions, storing them in your site's dashboard and optionally sending notifications, making it easy to manage and respond to form submissions without needing to write or maintain backend code.

## Workarounds (If No)
Not applicable, as Netlify does support form handling natively.

- **Alternative 1:** Vercel (Native support) - Offers a similar form handling feature with additional customization options.
