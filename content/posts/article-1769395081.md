# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information and sales pipeline data to ensure that both marketing and sales teams have a unified view of customer interactions.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing contact information and sales pipeline data between HubSpot and Salesforce to enhance customer engagement and sales conversion rates.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts) and setting up field mappings.

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customized workflows:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger (e.g., when a new contact is created)
3. Set Salesforce as the action (e.g., create a new lead)
4. Map fields accordingly, ensuring that relevant data (like email addresses and phone numbers) is correctly transferred between the two systems.

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Unified lead management across both platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For a bidirectional data flow, you can also set up workflows where updates in Salesforce trigger actions in HubSpot, such as updating contact properties or triggering marketing workflows based on sales pipeline stages.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens, ensuring that your login credentials are up to date and correctly entered.
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to comply with API rate limits and prevent service disruptions.
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping to ensure that all necessary fields are correctly mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce, preventing data loss during synchronization.

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for prompt intervention and minimizing data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain advanced data types may not sync directly through the native integration, requiring either Zapier/Make for more complex workflows or manual intervention.
- **Rate Limits:** Both HubSpot and Salesforce have API rate limits that can affect how frequently data can be synced, potentially impacting real-time data consistency.
- **Feature Gaps:** Certain features, like advanced sales forecasting, may not be available in lower tiers of either platform, limiting the depth of integration possible.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the integration requires at least the Professional tier of HubSpot for full functionality.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data can sync in real-time for many actions, but some workflows may be scheduled (e.g., every 15 minutes) due to API rate limits or customization preferences.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, it's possible to backfill historical data from one platform to the other, but this may require manual setup or the use of additional tools like Zapier or Make to handle the initial data migration effectively.
