* For enterprises with strict security and compliance requirements, Figma's enterprise plan offers advanced security features like SSO and audit logs.

## When to Choose Sketch
* If you're a solo designer or a small team of 2-3 people, Sketch's more affordable pricing and ease of use make it a great option for UI design.
* For teams already invested in the macOS ecosystem, Sketch's native integration with macOS apps like Apple Keynote and Apple Numbers makes it a more convenient choice.
* If you're working on a small-scale design project with a tight deadline, Sketch's gentler learning curve and more intuitive interface allow for faster onboarding and design completion.

## Real-World Use Case: UI Design
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person design team needs to design a new mobile app. With Figma, setup complexity takes around 2-3 days, including onboarding team members and setting up design systems. Ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low, with automated design system updates and real-time collaboration. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is approximately $1,200/month (billed annually). Common gotchas include ensuring proper design system implementation and managing feedback from multiple stakeholders. In contrast, Sketch would require around 1-2 days for setup, with a lower ongoing maintenance burden due to its more straightforward design workflow. However, Sketch's limitations in collaborative features and scalability would become apparent as the team grows.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Sketch to Figma, data export/import limitations include the need to manually recreate design systems and styles. Training time needed is around 1-2 weeks, depending on team size and complexity of designs. Hidden costs include potential downtime during the migration process and the need for additional support resources. Conversely, switching from Figma to Sketch requires less training time (around 1-3 days) but may result in a loss of advanced collaborative features and design system functionality.
