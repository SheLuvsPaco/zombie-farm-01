# Does Trello Have Subtasks? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Yes via Checklist feature. Trello's Checklist feature allows users to create subtasks within a larger task, enabling granular task management and organization. This feature provides a way to break down complex tasks into smaller, actionable items, although it may not offer the full functionality of dedicated subtask management found in other tools.

## How to Use Subtasks in Trello (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the card that represents the main task you want to add subtasks to.
2. Click on the "Checklist" button in the card's right sidebar or add a new checklist by clicking on the "+" icon and selecting "Checklist".
3. Result: You can now add individual items to the checklist, which function as subtasks, and check them off as they are completed, allowing you to track progress on the main task.

## Workarounds (If No)
Not applicable, as Trello supports subtasks via the Checklist feature.

## Better Alternatives for Subtasks

- **Alternative 1:** Asana (Native support) - Offers a dedicated subtask feature that allows for more detailed organization and assignment of tasks.
- **Alternative 2:** Jira (Better implementation) - Provides a robust subtasking system with advanced features like subtask assignment, due dates, and time tracking.
