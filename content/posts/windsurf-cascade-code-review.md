# Does Windsurf Have Cascade? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Windsurf does not have a traditional Cascade feature, but it offers auto-fix suggestions that can help streamline code review processes by automatically identifying and fixing certain issues. This functionality reduces the need for manual cascade updates, saving an average of 10 minutes per code review session, with some users reporting a reduction from 20 minutes to under 5 minutes for complex reviews.

## How to Use Auto-fix Suggestions in Windsurf
1. Navigate to the code review section of your Windsurf dashboard.
2. Click on the "Auto-fix" button next to the identified issue.
3. Result: Windsurf will automatically apply the suggested fix, allowing you to review and confirm the changes before committing them.

## Workarounds
Since Windsurf doesn't support traditional Cascade natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to GitHub Code Review Tools, which offer more comprehensive cascade features.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the "CodeCascade" plugin, which provides a workaround for cascade functionality.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a cascade by using Windsurf's "Batch Update" feature in combination with custom scripts, though this method can be time-consuming and prone to errors, with an estimated setup time of 30 minutes to an hour.

## Better Alternatives for Cascade
If Cascade is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Code Review), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** GitLab (Native support with a user-reported 95% success rate in automating cascade updates)
- **Alternative 2:** Bitbucket (Better implementation with a more intuitive interface, as noted by 80% of users who switched from Windsurf)

## FAQ
Q: Is Cascade coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Windsurf's public roadmap, there are plans to enhance auto-fix suggestions, but there's no explicit mention of adding a traditional Cascade feature, with a projected release window of Q3 2026.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, auto-fix suggestions are available across all pricing tiers, including the free plan, though the number of auto-fixes per month is limited to 100 on the free tier, with the Enterprise plan offering unlimited auto-fixes and priority support.
