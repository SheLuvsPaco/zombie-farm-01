## Real-World Use Case: AI Copy
Let's say you're a 20-person marketing team needing to generate 100 social media posts per week. With Anyword, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden would be relatively low due to its automated content scoring and predictive analytics. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $1,500 per month. Common gotchas include needing to fine-tune the predictive model for optimal results and ensuring data quality for accurate analytics. In contrast, Copy.ai would take around 1-2 days to set up, but its limited predictive features and integrations might require more manual effort and maintenance.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between these tools, data export/import limitations are a major concern. Anyword allows for bulk export of content data, while Copy.ai has limited export options. Training time needed for the new tool would be around 3-7 days, depending on the complexity of your use case. Hidden costs to consider include potential data migration fees and the need for additional support or training.
