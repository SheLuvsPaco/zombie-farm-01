# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manually updating calendars with task deadlines and due dates. This integration automates the process, reducing the time spent on manual updates by 5 hours/week. The use case for this integration is ideal for teams and individuals who use Trello for project management and Google Calendar for scheduling.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Project managers can use this integration to automatically schedule tasks and deadlines from Trello boards into Google Calendar, ensuring that all team members are aware of upcoming deadlines and can plan accordingly.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both Trello and Google Calendar

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as which boards and lists to sync

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., "New Card")
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., "Create Event")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Trello to Google Calendar
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New card in Trello | Create event in Google Calendar | Automated scheduling of tasks and deadlines |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Google Calendar events can also be synced back to Trello, allowing for bidirectional data flow. For example, if a meeting is scheduled in Google Calendar, a corresponding card can be created in Trello with the meeting details.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the due date field is mapped correctly

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers on errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar only syncs cards with due dates, and does not support syncing of other card attributes, such as comments or attachments.
- Google Calendar has a rate limit of 100 requests per 100 seconds, which can cause sync errors if the integration is triggered too frequently.
- The free tier of Trello has limited integration capabilities, and may not support syncing of all boards or lists.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier?
A: The native integration works with all tiers of Trello, but the free tier has limited integration capabilities.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to reduce the load on the APIs.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced, but it may require manual configuration and mapping of fields. Additionally, the amount of historical data that can be synced may be limited by the APIs and the integration tool used.
