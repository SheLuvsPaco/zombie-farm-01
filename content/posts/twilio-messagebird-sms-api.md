## Real-World Use Case: SMS API
Let's say you're a 50-person SaaS company that needs to send 5,000 SMS messages per day to customers in the United States and Europe. With Twilio, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden would be moderate (2-3 hours per week). The cost breakdown would be:
* Twilio: $375 per day (5,000 messages \* $0.0075 per message) = $11,250 per month
* MessageBird: $200 per day (5,000 messages \* $0.004 per message) = $6,000 per month
Common gotchas include ensuring compliance with SMS regulations in different countries and handling message delivery failures.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Twilio to MessageBird, data export/import limitations include the need to reconfigure SMS API settings and re-integrate with third-party services. Training time needed would be around 1-2 weeks, and hidden costs include potential message delivery failures during the migration process.
