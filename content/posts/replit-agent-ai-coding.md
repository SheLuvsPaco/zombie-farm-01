# Does Replit Have Agent? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Replit has an IDE assistant that provides coding suggestions and auto-completion, but it does not have a dedicated "Agent" feature like some other AI coding tools. The IDE assistant in Replit can still help with code completion, debugging, and other tasks, but it may not offer the same level of functionality as a full-fledged Agent.

## How to Use Agent in Replit (If Yes)
Since Replit does not have a dedicated Agent feature, the following steps describe how to use the IDE assistant:
1. Navigate to the Replit editor and start typing your code.
2. As you type, the IDE assistant will provide suggestions and auto-completion options.
3. Click on a suggestion to accept it, or continue typing to ignore it.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Replit doesn't support a dedicated Agent feature natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to GitHub's Copilot, which offers AI-powered code completion and suggestions.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the Kite plugin, which provides AI-powered code completion and documentation.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually configure Replit to use an external AI coding tool, such as Tabnine, through the Replit API or by using a third-party service like Zapier.

## Better Alternatives for Agent
If Agent is a dealbreaker for your workflow (AI Coding), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** GitHub Copilot (Native support)
- **Alternative 2:** Tabnine (Better implementation)

## FAQ
Q: Is Agent coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Replit's public roadmap, there are plans to enhance the IDE assistant with more AI-powered features, but a dedicated Agent feature is not explicitly mentioned.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The IDE assistant in Replit is available to all users, regardless of their pricing plan, but some advanced features may be limited to the Pro or Team plans.
