# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manually updating calendars with task deadlines and due dates. This integration saves teams 5 hours/week by automating the process, allowing them to focus on more critical tasks. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Managing project deadlines and team schedules

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both Trello and Google Calendar

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as which board to sync and the calendar to update

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., when a card is moved to a list)
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., create a new event)
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Card to Event
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| Card moved to "To-Do" list in Trello | Create a new event in Google Calendar | Event created with card title and due date |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
When an event is updated in Google Calendar, the corresponding card in Trello can be updated with the new event details, such as the event title or description.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring the card title is mapped to the event title

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing you to quickly resolve issues and minimize downtime.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar only supports syncing one board at a time
- Google Calendar has a rate limit of 100 requests per minute, which can be exceeded if syncing a large number of cards
- The free tier of Trello has limited automation features, which can limit the complexity of workflows

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of Trello?
A: Yes, the integration works with the free tier of Trello, but with limited automation features.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to avoid rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced, but it may require manual configuration and backfilling of data.
