## Real-World Use Case: PaaS
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person SaaS company needs to set up a PaaS solution for 100 users with basic integration requirements. With Upsun, the setup complexity would be approximately 2 hours, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown would be $500/month (flat rate) plus any additional usage-based fees. In contrast, Platform.sh would require a custom quote based on usage, with a setup complexity of approximately 5 hours and an ongoing maintenance burden of 2-3 hours per week. The cost breakdown would be $1,500/month (estimated) plus any additional usage-based fees. Common gotchas include underestimating usage-based fees and overlooking the importance of forking capabilities.

If switching between Upsun and Platform.sh, consider the following:
- Data export/import limitations: Upsun has a more straightforward data export process, while Platform.sh requires more manual effort.
- Training time needed: Platform.sh requires more extensive training due to its advanced features and customization options (approximately 1-2 weeks).
- Hidden costs: Be aware of usage-based fees, additional support costs, and potential customization expenses when migrating to Platform.sh.
