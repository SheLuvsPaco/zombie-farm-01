# Does Shopify Have Abandoned Cart Recovery? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Shopify has abandoned cart recovery built into all of its plans, allowing merchants to automatically send reminders to customers who have left items in their cart without completing the purchase. This feature is a crucial component of revenue recovery, as it helps merchants re-engage potential customers and reduce lost sales, with the potential to recover up to 30% of abandoned carts, translating to a significant increase in revenue, such as recovering $1,500 in sales from 50 abandoned carts with a $30 average order value.

## How to Use Abandoned Cart Recovery in Shopify
1. Navigate to the "Settings" section in your Shopify admin dashboard and click on "Checkout" to access the abandoned cart recovery settings.
2. Click on "Abandoned cart recovery" and toggle the switch to enable the feature, then configure the email settings to customize the recovery emails sent to customers, such as setting the email to send 1 hour after cart abandonment with a 10% discount code.
3. Result: Shopify will automatically send a series of reminder emails to customers who have abandoned their carts, with the goal of recovering lost sales and increasing revenue, for example, reducing cart abandonment rates by 25% and increasing sales by 15% within a 3-month period.

## Workarounds (Not Applicable)
Since Shopify has abandoned cart recovery built into all plans, there is no need for workarounds. However, merchants can further customize their abandoned cart recovery strategy by using third-party apps, such as:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a customer relationship management (CRM) tool like HubSpot to track customer interactions and personalize recovery emails.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Recart to add advanced features like cart abandonment analytics and personalized product recommendations.
3. **The "Hack":** Use a manual workaround like creating a custom email template with a personalized message and discount code to send to customers who have abandoned their carts, but this approach can be time-consuming and may not be as effective as using Shopify's built-in feature.

## Better Alternatives for Abandoned Cart Recovery
If Shopify's abandoned cart recovery feature is not meeting your workflow needs, consider the following alternatives:
- **Alternative 1:** BigCommerce (Native support with advanced features like cart abandonment analytics and personalized product recommendations, allowing merchants to recover up to 40% of abandoned carts).
- **Alternative 2:** Magento (Better implementation with customizable email templates and automation rules, enabling merchants to recover up to 35% of abandoned carts and increase sales by 20%).
