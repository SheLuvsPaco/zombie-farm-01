## Real-World Use Case: Coding CLI
Both Claude Code and Aider can handle coding CLI scenarios, but they differ in setup complexity and ongoing maintenance burden. Claude Code requires a more complex setup, taking around 2-3 days, but provides more advanced features and better support. Aider, on the other hand, has a simpler setup, taking around 1-2 hours, but may require more manual configuration and maintenance. For 100 users and actions, Claude Code would cost around $15,000 per year, while Aider would cost around $3,000 per year. However, Claude Code's advanced reasoning capabilities and priority support may be worth the extra cost for teams with complex coding requirements.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Claude Code and Aider, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Claude Code has more comprehensive data export options, but Aider's data import process is more straightforward.
* Training time needed: Claude Code requires more extensive training, around 2-3 weeks, while Aider requires around 1-2 days.
* Hidden costs: Claude Code's custom quote-based pricing may include additional costs for support and maintenance, while Aider's pricing is more transparent.
