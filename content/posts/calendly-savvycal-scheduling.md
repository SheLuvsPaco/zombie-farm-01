- For teams with limited budget (less than $100/month), Calendly's pricing model is more affordable.

## When to Choose SavvyCal
- If you're a larger team (more than 50 users) requiring advanced customization options for booking pages, SavvyCal's personalized booking experience is worth the investment.
- For teams that need to schedule complex, multi-step meetings or appointments, SavvyCal's customizable workflows and conditional logic are more suitable.

## Real-World Use Case: Scheduling
Let's consider a scenario where a 20-person sales team needs to schedule meetings with potential clients. With Calendly, setup takes around 1-2 hours, and ongoing maintenance is minimal. The cost for 100 users/actions would be approximately $800-$1,200 per month. However, Calendly's limited customization options might not provide the desired level of personalization. On the other hand, SavvyCal requires 2-4 hours for setup and has a higher cost of $1,200-$2,000 per month for 100 users/actions. Nevertheless, SavvyCal's advanced customization options and personalized booking experience might be worth the extra investment. A common gotcha with both tools is the need to regularly update user permissions and access controls to ensure data security.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Calendly and SavvyCal, be aware of the following:
- Data export/import limitations: Both tools allow data export, but importing data into the new tool may require manual formatting and mapping.
- Training time needed: Calendly requires minimal training (1-2 hours), while SavvyCal needs 2-4 hours due to its more complex features.
- Hidden costs: When migrating, consider the potential costs of reconfiguring integrations, updating workflows, and retraining team members.
