## Real-World Use Case: Customer Support
Let's say you're a 50-person SaaS company with a growing customer base, and you need to handle 5,000 customer support tickets per month. With Zendesk, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden would be moderate, requiring 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $1,900 per month. With Freshdesk, setup complexity would take around 1-2 days, and ongoing maintenance burden would be low, requiring 30 minutes per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $1,200 per month. However, Freshdesk's basic automation features and limited reporting capabilities might not be sufficient to handle the high volume of tickets.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Zendesk and Freshdesk, data export/import limitations are a concern, as both platforms have limited export options. Training time needed would be around 1-2 weeks, depending on the complexity of the setup. Hidden costs to consider include potential customization costs, integration fees, and support costs.
