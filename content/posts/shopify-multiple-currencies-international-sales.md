# Does Shopify Have Multiple Currencies? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Native support via Shopify Markets allows merchants to sell in multiple currencies, providing a more localized shopping experience for international customers. This feature enables merchants to set prices and display currencies specific to different markets, streamlining the process of expanding their business globally.

## How to Use Multiple Currencies in Shopify
1. Navigate to the Shopify admin panel and click on "Settings" followed by "Markets" to access the markets settings.
2. Click on "Add market" and select the countries or regions you want to sell to, then configure the currency and pricing settings for each market.
3. Result: Your store will now display prices in the local currency for each market, and customers can checkout in their local currency, reducing the complexity of international transactions and improving the overall customer experience.

## Workarounds (Not Necessary)
Since Shopify provides native support for multiple currencies via Shopify Markets, workarounds are not necessary. However, for merchants who may need additional functionality or customization, third-party apps and integrations are available to further enhance the multi-currency experience.
