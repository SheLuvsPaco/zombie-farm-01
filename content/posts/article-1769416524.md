# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manual synchronization between project management boards and calendar events, reducing the risk of missed deadlines and double bookings. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Managing multiple projects with deadlines and scheduling meetings with team members.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both tools

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as calendar selection and due date mapping

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., new card creation)
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., create new event)
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Card to Event
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New card created in Trello | New event created in Google Calendar | Trello card due date synced with Google Calendar event |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Google Calendar events can also be synced back to Trello as new cards, allowing for bidirectional data flow and ensuring that all team members are informed of schedule changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the Trello card due date is properly mapped to the Google Calendar event date

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for quick resolution and minimizing downtime.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar only supports syncing due dates, not start dates or reminders
- Google Calendar has a rate limit of 50,000,000 quota units per day for the Google Calendar API
- The free tier of Trello has limited integration capabilities compared to the paid tiers

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of Trello?
A: Yes, but with limited integration capabilities, such as only syncing due dates.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for native integrations, but may be limited to every 15 minutes for Zapier/Make integrations.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, but only for the last 1000 cards in Trello, due to API limitations.
