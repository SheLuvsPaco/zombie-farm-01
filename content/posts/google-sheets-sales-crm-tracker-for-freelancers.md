# Free Google Sheets CRM Tracker for Freelancers Template (2026 Blueprint)

## Why You Need This Template
Building a CRM tracker from scratch can be a significant time waste, taking up to 10 hours to set up and customize, especially for freelancers who need to focus on their core services. This template handles pipeline management with dashboards automatically, eliminating the need for coding or extensive setup. It's designed specifically for freelancers and small agencies who need to manage multiple clients, projects, and tasks efficiently. With this template, you can reduce the time spent on manual data entry and focus on high-leverage activities like sales, marketing, and delivery.

## Template Features Breakdown
- **Core View 1:** The main dashboard, titled "Client Overview," provides a comprehensive view of all clients, including their contact information, project status, and communication history. This table is filtered to show only active clients, making it easy to prioritize tasks and follow-ups. For example, you can use this view to identify clients who are awaiting feedback or have upcoming deadlines.
- **Automation:** The template includes pre-built logic to automatically update the project status based on the completion of tasks. For instance, when you mark a task as "completed," the project status will automatically change to "in progress" or "completed," depending on the task's dependency. This automation saves you around 30 minutes per day, which can be better spent on high-priority tasks.
- **Fields Included:** The template includes key data points such as:
  - Client name and contact information
  - Project name and description
  - Task list with due dates and status
  - Communication log with email and phone call records
  - Sales pipeline with opportunity value and stage
  - Time tracking with hourly rate and total hours worked
