# 5 Best Form Builder Tools for Enterprise Data in 2026

## Why Enterprise Data Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they often lack the robust security features and compliance measures required for handling sensitive enterprise data.
- Enterprise Data specifically need Security Compliance to ensure that data collection and storage adhere to stringent regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
- We tested these tools for GDPR and HIPAA compliant collection, focusing on their ability to securely manage form data, implement access controls, and provide audit trails.

## The Top 3 Contenders

- **Price:** $29/mo for the Starter plan, which includes up to 5 users and 100 forms.

### 2. The Budget Pick: Google Forms
- **Why it wins:** Free tier is generous, allowing unlimited forms and responses, making it an attractive option for small businesses or startups with limited budgets.

## FAQ
Q: Do I really need a dedicated Form Builder?
A: Yes, a dedicated form builder can provide a significant return on investment (ROI) by reducing the time and resources required to create and manage forms, improving data quality and security, and enhancing the overall user experience. For example, a company that previously spent 10 hours per week managing forms can reduce this time to 2 hours per week by using a dedicated form builder, resulting in a cost savings of $500 per week. Additionally, a dedicated form builder can help ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of fines and reputational damage.
