# Does Pipedrive Have Email Sync? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Pipedrive supports two-way email sync, allowing users to synchronize their emails with the platform, thereby keeping their conversation history up-to-date. This feature enables users to access all email communications related to a deal or contact directly within Pipedrive, streamlining their workflow and enhancing productivity.

## How to Use Email Sync in Pipedrive
1. Navigate to the "Settings" section in your Pipedrive account and select "Email Sync" from the menu.
2. Click on "Connect your email account" and follow the prompts to authorize Pipedrive to access your email account, choosing from supported email providers such as Gmail or Outlook.
3. Result: Once connected, Pipedrive will sync your emails, allowing you to view and manage all email communications related to your contacts and deals directly within the platform, with emails being updated in real-time, reducing sync time from 15 minutes to as little as 30 seconds.

## Workarounds (Not Necessary)
Since Pipedrive natively supports email sync, there's no need for workarounds. However, for users looking to integrate email sync with other tools or requiring more advanced email management features, Pipedrive's API and integration with third-party apps can provide additional functionality.

## Better Alternatives for Email Sync
If for any reason Pipedrive's email sync does not fully meet your needs, or if you're evaluating other CRM solutions with robust email integration, consider:
- **HubSpot CRM**: Offers native email sync with a more comprehensive set of sales and marketing tools.
- **Salesforce**: Provides advanced email integration and management capabilities, particularly useful for large-scale enterprises.
