# Does Slack Have Read Receipts? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Slack does not have traditional read receipts like some other messaging platforms, but it does offer delivery confirmation, which indicates that a message has been delivered to the recipient's device. However, it does not provide confirmation that the recipient has actually read the message, only that it has been delivered and potentially seen.

## How to Use Read Receipts in Slack (If Yes)
Since Slack does not support traditional read receipts, there is no native way to use this feature. However, users can use the "delivered" and "seen" indicators to gauge whether their messages have been received by the recipient.
1. Navigate to the conversation where you sent the message.
2. Look for the "delivered" checkmark next to the message, indicating that the message has been delivered to the recipient's device.
3. If the recipient has seen the message, the checkmark will change to a "seen" indicator, but this is not a guarantee that the recipient has actually read the message.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Slack doesn't support traditional read receipts natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like Zapier or Automate.io to create custom workflows that can provide read receipt-like functionality.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Slack Reader or Read Receipts for Slack, which can provide read receipt functionality, but may have limitations and require additional setup.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually ask the recipient to confirm that they have read the message, or use a separate messaging platform that supports read receipts for critical communications.

## Better Alternatives for Read Receipts
If Read Receipts is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Message Read), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Microsoft Teams (Native support)
- **Alternative 2:** Discord (Better implementation)

## FAQ
Q: Is Read Receipts coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Slack's public roadmap, there are no plans to add traditional read receipts, but the company is exploring ways to improve message delivery and read indicators.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, the delivery confirmation feature is available to all Slack users, regardless of their pricing plan. However, some integrations and plugins may require a paid plan or subscription to access additional features.
