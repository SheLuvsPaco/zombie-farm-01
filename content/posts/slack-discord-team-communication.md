## When to Choose Slack
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing advanced integrations with tools like Salesforce and Google Drive, Slack's comprehensive integration library makes it the better choice.
* For large, distributed teams with complex communication needs, Slack's customizable channels and priority support ensure seamless communication.
* If your team requires advanced security features, such as data loss prevention and compliance exports, Slack's enterprise plan provides the necessary tools.
* For teams with a large budget, Slack's custom pricing plan can be tailored to meet specific needs.

## When to Choose Discord
* If you're a 10-person gaming community or small team with simple communication needs, Discord's free plan provides an affordable and user-friendly solution.
* For teams that require low-latency voice and video communication, Discord's gaming-focused features make it the better choice.
* If your team is already familiar with Discord's interface and features, it may be more convenient to stick with the platform rather than migrating to Slack.
* For small teams or communities with limited budgets, Discord's Nitro plan provides a cost-effective solution with additional features.

## Real-World Use Case: Team Communication
Let's consider a 100-person marketing team that needs to communicate and collaborate on campaigns. 
* Setup complexity: Slack requires 2-3 days to set up, while Discord can be set up in 1 day.
* Ongoing maintenance burden: Slack requires more maintenance, with a dedicated administrator needed to manage channels and integrations. Discord is more self-sufficient, with users able to manage their own channels and settings.
* Cost breakdown: For 100 users, Slack's standard plan would cost $725 per month, while Discord's Nitro plan would cost $999 per month. However, Discord's free plan could be sufficient for smaller teams.
* Common gotchas: Slack's comprehensive integration library can be overwhelming, and users may need to spend time configuring and customizing integrations. Discord's limited integration library may require users to find workarounds or use third-party tools.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Slack and Discord, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Slack provides a comprehensive data export feature, while Discord's data export is limited.
* Training time needed: Slack requires 2-3 days of training, while Discord can be learned in 1 day.
* Hidden costs: Slack's custom pricing plan may include additional fees for support and integration services.
