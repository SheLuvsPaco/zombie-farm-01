## When to Choose Hono
* If you're a 10-person startup with a simple network setup and limited budget, Hono's flat fee pricing and easy learning curve make it an attractive choice.
* If you prioritize ease of use and don't require advanced features, Hono's intuitive interface and basic routing capabilities may be sufficient.
* If you're a 20-person team with a small network and limited scalability needs, Hono's cost-effective solution and decent support may be enough.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing a basic Edge Router solution with minimal setup and maintenance, Hono could be a good fit.

## When to Choose Nitro
* If you're a 100-person enterprise with complex network requirements and a large budget, Nitro's advanced features, scalability, and 24/7 phone support make it a better choice.
* If you require advanced routing, traffic shaping, and QoS, Nitro's robust feature set and customizable options are more suitable.
* If you're a 50-person team with a large network and high scalability needs, Nitro's tiered pricing and support for up to 10,000 users may be more cost-effective in the long run.
* For instance, if you're a 200-person company with a complex network setup and multiple Edge Routers, Nitro's advanced features and support may be necessary.

## Real-World Use Case: Edge Router
Let's consider a scenario where a 20-person team needs to set up an Edge Router for their small network. With Hono, the setup complexity is relatively low, taking around 2-3 hours to configure. Ongoing maintenance burden is also minimal, requiring only occasional updates and monitoring. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $500/month. However, common gotchas include limited scalability and basic features. In contrast, Nitro requires more setup time (around 5-7 hours) and ongoing maintenance, but offers more advanced features and scalability. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $800/month.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Hono and Nitro, data export/import limitations may apply, and training time needed can range from 1-4 weeks. Hidden costs, such as consulting fees or additional hardware requirements, should also be considered. For example, migrating from Hono to Nitro may require additional training on advanced features and customization options.
