# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information, lead status, and sales activity between HubSpot's marketing and sales tools and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) platform.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing contact information and lead status between marketing and sales teams to ensure data consistency and streamline sales follow-up.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts) and setting the sync frequency

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or a scenario in Make (formerly Integromat)
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app (e.g., "New Contact in HubSpot")
3. Set Salesforce as the action app (e.g., "Create Contact in Salesforce")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot contact properties to Salesforce contact fields

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New Lead in HubSpot | Create Lead in Salesforce | Leads are automatically synced between HubSpot and Salesforce, ensuring sales teams have the latest information. |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, you can set up a reverse sync where updates made in Salesforce are synced back to HubSpot. This ensures that both systems have the most current information and reduces data discrepancies.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by reconnecting the integration in HubSpot's settings.
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to comply with Salesforce's API limits.
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping to ensure all necessary fields are correctly mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce.

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when the sync breaks, allowing for quick intervention and minimizing data inconsistencies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain advanced data types in Salesforce may not sync with HubSpot due to compatibility issues.
- **Rate Limits:** Salesforce has API call limits that can affect the frequency of syncs, potentially leading to delays in data updates.
- **Feature Gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot and certain lower tiers of Salesforce may have limited integration capabilities or require additional setup through Zapier/Make.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: The integration is available on HubSpot's Professional and Enterprise tiers. For the free tier, consider using Zapier/Make for a customized integration.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data can sync in real-time or on a scheduled basis, depending on the setup and tier of your accounts.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can backfill historical data from one platform to the other, but this may require additional setup and could be subject to API limits.
