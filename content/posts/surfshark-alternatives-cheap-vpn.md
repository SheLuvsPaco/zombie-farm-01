## FAQ
Q: Do I really need a dedicated Surfshark or VPN tool for budget privacy?
A: Yes, a dedicated VPN tool can provide a significant return on investment (ROI) by protecting your data from breaches, saving you from potential legal and financial repercussions, and ensuring your online activities remain private. For example, a single data breach can cost an individual or small business thousands of dollars in recovery and legal fees. By spending a few dollars a month on a VPN, you can significantly reduce this risk, making it a worthwhile investment for those serious about their online privacy and security.
