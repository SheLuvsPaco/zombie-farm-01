## Why Alternatives Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they often lack the nuanced functionality required to manage complex, two-sided payment systems that are typical in marketplace environments.
- Alternatives specifically need Marketplaces that can handle the intricacies of facilitating transactions between multiple parties, ensuring that both buyers and sellers have a seamless and secure experience.
- We tested these tools for two-sided payments, focusing on their ability to efficiently process transactions, manage disputes, and provide transparent reporting, all of which are critical for maintaining trust and compliance in a marketplace setting.
