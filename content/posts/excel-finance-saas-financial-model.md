# Free Excel SaaS Financial Model Template (2026 Blueprint)

## Why You Need This Template
Building a SaaS financial model from scratch can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, taking up to 20 hours or more to complete, depending on the complexity of the model. This can divert valuable time and resources away from core business activities, such as product development and customer acquisition. The Free Excel SaaS Financial Model Template handles startup runway and MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) projections automatically, providing a comprehensive and accurate financial outlook for your business. This template is ideal for freelancers, agencies, and small to medium-sized businesses that need to track their financial performance and make data-driven decisions.

## Template Features Breakdown
- **Core View 1:** The main dashboard of the template provides a clear and concise overview of the company's financial performance, including key metrics such as revenue, expenses, and cash flow. The dashboard is divided into four sections: Revenue Projections, Expense Projections, Cash Flow Projections, and Key Metrics. For example, the revenue projections section allows you to input your monthly recurring revenue, average revenue per user, and customer acquisition costs, and then automatically calculates your total revenue and revenue growth rate.
- **Automation:** The template includes pre-built logic to automatically calculate startup runway and MRR projections based on user-inputted data, such as revenue growth rate, customer churn rate, and average revenue per user. This automation saves users an average of 10 hours per month, which can be spent on higher-value activities such as business development and strategy.
- **Fields Included:** The template includes key data points such as revenue growth rate, customer acquisition costs, average revenue per user, customer churn rate, and expense categories (e.g., salaries, marketing, and infrastructure). These fields are customizable to fit the specific needs of your business, and can be used to track and analyze your financial performance over time.

## FAQ

Q: Can I share this with clients?
