# Does Notion Have Read Receipts? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Notion provides a form of visitor tracking through its page view statistics, which can give you an idea of who has viewed a page, but it does not offer traditional read receipts like some other collaboration tools. This means you can see how many times a page has been viewed and by whom, but you won't receive a direct notification when someone reads a specific page or message.

## How to Use Read Receipts in Notion (If Yes)
Since Notion's approach to read receipts is more about page view tracking, here's how you can utilize this feature:
1. Navigate to the page you're interested in tracking.
2. Click on the "Page Info" button at the top right corner of the page.
3. Result: You'll see the number of views and who last edited the page, but for a more detailed view of page statistics, including who has viewed the page, you would need to use Notion's built-in analytics or consider integrations.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Notion doesn't support traditional read receipts natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to tools like Zapier or Integromat to set up custom workflows that notify you when a page is viewed.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install plugins like Page Views or Notion Analytics to get more detailed insights into page views, though these might not offer exact read receipt functionality.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually add a "Sign-off" or "Acknowledgement" section at the bottom of your pages, where team members can manually indicate they've read the content by typing their name or initials, though this is not automated.

## Better Alternatives for Read Receipts
If Read Receipts is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Page Views), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Slack (Native support for read receipts in direct messages and channels).
- **Alternative 2:** Microsoft Teams (Better implementation with read receipts for chats and channel messages).

## FAQ
Q: Is Read Receipts coming in the roadmap?
A: As of the last public roadmap update, there was no mention of traditional read receipts being added to Notion, but the company is continually updating its features, so it's worth keeping an eye on their official blog and community forum for future announcements.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The current page view statistics feature in Notion is available across most of its plans, including the free version, though some advanced analytics features might be limited to higher-tier plans, including the Enterprise plan. However, traditional read receipts, as they are not natively supported, do not have a specific pricing tier associated with them.
