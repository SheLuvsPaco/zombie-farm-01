# Does Obsidian Have Cloud Sync? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Obsidian offers cloud sync as a paid add-on, allowing users to access their notes across multiple devices. However, users can also utilize free iCloud sync as a workaround, albeit with some limitations, such as manual configuration and potential compatibility issues.

## How to Use Cloud Sync in Obsidian (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the Obsidian settings panel by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left corner of the application window.
2. Click on the "Core Plugins" tab and scroll down to the "Sync" section, then click on the "Enable" button next to "Obsidian Sync" (note: this requires a paid subscription).
3. Result: Your Obsidian vault will be synced across all devices linked to your account, with changes reflected in near real-time (typically within 1-2 minutes, depending on internet connectivity).

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Obsidian's native cloud sync requires a paid subscription, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a third-party service like Git, which allows for version control and syncing, albeit with a steeper learning curve (approximately 30 minutes to an hour to set up).
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the "iCloud Sync" plugin, which enables syncing with iCloud, but may require manual configuration and has potential compatibility issues (e.g., file size limits, syncing delays).
3. **The "Hack":** Manually sync your Obsidian vault by copying the entire folder to a cloud storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive, then configuring Obsidian to use the cloud-stored vault on each device (note: this method can be error-prone and may lead to version conflicts).

## Better Alternatives for Cloud Sync
If Cloud Sync is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Multi-device Access), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Notion (Native support, with real-time syncing across all devices and a user-friendly interface).
- **Alternative 2:** Evernote (Better implementation, with advanced features like offline access and end-to-end encryption).

## FAQ
Q: Is Cloud Sync coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Obsidian's public roadmap, cloud sync is a highly requested feature, but no official release date has been announced (as of January 2026).

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Obsidian's cloud sync feature is available as a paid add-on to all users, regardless of their plan (including the Personal plan, which costs $4/month or $40/year).
