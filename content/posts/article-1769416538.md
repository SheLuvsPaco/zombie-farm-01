# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with data silos and manual data entry. By connecting these two tools, teams can automate lead tracking, contact management, and sales pipeline updates. 
- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Streamlining lead nurturing and sales handoff processes for a mid-sized B2B company.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or Make
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, such as contact information and lead status

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Nurturing
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Automated lead tracking and assignment |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce updates can trigger actions in HubSpot, such as updating contact properties or triggering workflows. For example, when a deal is closed in Salesforce, HubSpot can automatically update the contact's lifecycle stage.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by re-connecting the integration
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid hitting API rate limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure all necessary fields are synced

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for prompt troubleshooting and minimizing data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- [Specific data types that don't sync]: Custom objects and certain Salesforce fields may not be supported by the native integration.
- [Rate limits on either side]: Both HubSpot and Salesforce have API rate limits that can impact sync frequency and data volume.
- [Feature gaps between tiers]: Certain features, such as advanced workflow automation, may only be available in higher-tier plans.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier?
A: No, the native integration requires at least a Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier in HubSpot, and an Enterprise or Unlimited tier in Salesforce.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but can be scheduled to sync at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to avoid rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, the integration supports backfilling historical data, but this may require additional setup and configuration to ensure data consistency and avoid duplicates.
