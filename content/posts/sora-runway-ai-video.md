## Real-World Use Case: AI Video
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to analyze customer support videos to improve their service. With Sora, setup complexity takes around 3-5 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is moderate (5-10 hours per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $15,000 per year. Common gotchas include the need for in-house AI expertise and potential integration issues with other tools. In contrast, Runway's setup complexity takes around 1-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is low (1-5 hours per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $6,000 per year. However, Runway's limited customization options and basic AI video features may not be sufficient for advanced use cases.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Sora and Runway, data export/import limitations include the need to reformat data for compatibility with the new platform. Training time needed for the new platform is around 1-3 weeks, depending on the complexity of the use case. Hidden costs include potential integration fees and custom development costs for advanced features.
