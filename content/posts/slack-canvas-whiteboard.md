# Does Slack Have Canvas? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: No
Slack does not have a native Canvas feature, which is often associated with digital whiteboard capabilities for collaborative brainstorming and note-taking. However, Slack offers a range of integrations and apps that can provide similar functionality, allowing teams to collaborate in a shared, visual space.

## Workarounds
Since Slack doesn't support a native Canvas feature, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Mural, a digital workspace for collaboration, to access a canvas-like experience directly within Slack.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the Google Jamboard app to bring a digital whiteboard into your Slack channels.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a shared note or document using Slack's built-in file sharing and editing features, and use it as a makeshift canvas for simple collaborations, although this method lacks the interactive and visual features of a dedicated canvas tool.

## Better Alternatives for Canvas
If Canvas is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Whiteboard), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Microsoft Teams (Native support) - Offers a built-in Whiteboard app for collaborative note-taking and brainstorming.
- **Alternative 2:** Notion (Better implementation) - Provides an all-in-one workspace where you can create a canvas-like page with drag-and-drop blocks, ideal for note-taking, brainstorming, and project planning.

## FAQ
Q: Is Canvas coming in the roadmap?
A: As of the latest public roadmap update, there's no official announcement from Slack regarding the development of a native Canvas feature. However, Slack continuously updates its platform with new features and integrations, so it's possible that future updates may address this functionality.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The lack of a native Canvas feature in Slack is not specific to any pricing tier, including the Enterprise plan. All Slack users, regardless of their plan, can utilize the workarounds and integrations mentioned to achieve similar collaboration outcomes.
