# Does Drizzle Have Kit? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Drizzle does have a project starter feature that can be considered similar to Kit, but it's not a direct equivalent. This project starter allows users to quickly set up new projects with pre-configured templates, which can simplify the scaffolding process, but it may not offer all the functionalities that one might expect from a full-fledged Kit feature.

## How to Use Kit in Drizzle (If Yes)
Since Drizzle's project starter is the closest feature to Kit, here's how to use it:
1. Navigate to the Drizzle CLI and run the command `drizzle init` to start a new project.
2. Click through the prompts to select the project template that best fits your needs.
3. Result: Drizzle will set up a new project with the selected template, including basic file structure and configuration, reducing the initial setup time from around 10 minutes to approximately 1 minute.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Drizzle's project starter is not a full Kit implementation, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Tool X, a third-party service that offers more comprehensive scaffolding capabilities, including support for custom templates and advanced project configurations.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the "ScaffoldPro" plugin, which extends Drizzle's project starter with additional features, such as automated dependency management and integration with popular development frameworks.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a custom project template by duplicating an existing project and modifying its configuration files, which can be time-consuming but provides full control over the project setup.

## Better Alternatives for Kit
If Kit is a crucial feature for your workflow (CLI Scaffolding), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Toolio (Native support) - Offers a robust Kit feature with support for custom templates, automated dependency management, and integration with popular development frameworks.
- **Alternative 2:** ScaffoldHub (Better implementation) - Provides a more comprehensive scaffolding solution, including support for multi-project workflows, automated testing, and continuous integration.

## FAQ
Q: Is Kit coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Drizzle's public roadmap, there are plans to enhance the project starter feature with more advanced scaffolding capabilities, but a specific release date has not been announced.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Drizzle's project starter feature is available in all pricing tiers, including the free plan, although some advanced features and integrations may require a paid subscription.
