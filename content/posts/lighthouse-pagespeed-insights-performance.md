## Real-World Use Case: Performance
Let's consider a scenario where we need to optimize the performance of a high-traffic e-commerce website. With Lighthouse, setup complexity is around 2-3 hours, with ongoing maintenance burden of approximately 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $0, since Lighthouse is free and open-source. However, common gotchas include the need for technical expertise and the potential for overwhelming amounts of data. In contrast, PageSpeed Insights has a setup complexity of around 30 minutes, with ongoing maintenance burden of approximately 30 minutes per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is also $0, since PageSpeed Insights is free. However, common gotchas include limited customization options and less detailed audits.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights, data export/import limitations are a significant concern, as both tools have different data formats and structures. Training time needed is around 1-2 weeks, depending on the team's technical expertise and familiarity with the new tool. Hidden costs include potential losses in productivity and performance during the migration process, which can be mitigated with careful planning and execution.
