# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manually updating calendars with task deadlines and due dates. This integration saves teams 5 hours/week by automating the process of syncing Trello cards with Google Calendar events. A common use case is for project managers to visualize and schedule tasks more efficiently, ensuring that team members are aware of upcoming deadlines.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Project management, task scheduling, and team collaboration

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both Trello and Google Calendar

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as which board and calendar to sync

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., "New Card")
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., "Create Event")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Trello to Google Calendar
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New card in Trello | Create event in Google Calendar | Trello card due date is synced with Google Calendar event |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Google Calendar events can also be synced back to Trello as new cards, allowing for bidirectional data flow. This is particularly useful for teams that use both tools for task management and scheduling.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the Trello card title is mapped to the Google Calendar event title

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers on Trello or Google Calendar errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar only syncs due dates and not start dates.
- Google Calendar has a rate limit of 1000 events per calendar per day.
- The free tier of Trello has limited integration capabilities compared to the paid tiers.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of Trello?
A: Yes, but with limited integration capabilities. The free tier only allows for one-way syncing from Trello to Google Calendar.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to avoid rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, Trello's native integration with Google Calendar allows for backfilling of historical data. However, this may be subject to Google Calendar's rate limits.
