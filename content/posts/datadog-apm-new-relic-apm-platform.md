# Datadog APM vs New Relic: Which is Better for APM Platform?

## Quick Verdict
For small to medium-sized teams with a budget under $10,000 per year, Datadog APM is the better choice due to its more flexible pricing model and lower costs. However, for larger enterprises with complex APM needs, New Relic's robust feature set and scalability make it a more suitable option. Ultimately, the choice between Datadog APM and New Relic depends on your team's specific requirements and budget.

## When to Choose Datadog APM
* If you're a 20-person startup with a limited budget and need a cost-effective APM solution, Datadog APM's per-host pricing model can save you up to 50% compared to New Relic.
* If you have a large, distributed team with diverse tooling and need a high degree of customization, Datadog APM's extensive integration library and flexible pricing model make it a better fit.
* If you're already using Datadog for monitoring and logging, adding APM capabilities can be a natural extension of your existing workflow.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to monitor a large number of hosts, Datadog APM's per-host pricing can reduce your costs from $3,750 per month (New Relic) to $1,500 per month.

## When to Choose New Relic
* If you're a large enterprise with complex APM needs and require a high degree of support and hand-holding, New Relic's premium support options and dedicated account management make it a better choice.
* If you have a small team with simple APM needs and prioritize ease of use, New Relic's more intuitive interface and streamlined onboarding process can get you up and running faster.
* If you're already invested in the New Relic ecosystem and have existing instrumentation, switching to Datadog APM may not be worth the migration costs.
* For instance, if you're a 100-person enterprise with a dedicated APM team, New Relic's per-user pricing model can provide more predictable costs and better support for your team's needs.

## Real-World Use Case: APM Platform
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to monitor its application performance. With Datadog APM, setup complexity is around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low due to automated instrumentation. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $1,500 per month. In contrast, New Relic would require a more extensive setup process (5-7 days) and higher ongoing maintenance burden due to manual instrumentation. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $3,750 per month. Common gotchas include underestimating the complexity of setup and ongoing maintenance, as well as overestimating the benefits of premium support.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Datadog APM and New Relic, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Both tools have limitations on data export and import, so plan for potential data loss during migration.
* Training time needed: New Relic's more intuitive interface requires less training time (around 1-2 weeks), while Datadog APM's steeper learning curve requires more training time (around 4-6 weeks).
* Hidden costs: Be aware of potential hidden costs, such as data storage and retention fees, which can add up quickly.

Q: Which has better ROI for APM Platform?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, Datadog APM can provide a better ROI for small to medium-sized teams, with estimated cost savings of up to 50% compared to New Relic.
