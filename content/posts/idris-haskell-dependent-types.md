# Idris vs Haskell: Which is Better for Dependent Types?

## Quick Verdict
For teams of less than 20 people with a budget under $10,000 per year, Idris is the better choice for dependent types due to its more straightforward learning curve and lower cost. However, for larger teams or those already invested in the Haskell ecosystem, Haskell's scalability and extensive library support make it a more suitable option. Ultimately, the choice between Idris and Haskell depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | Idris | Haskell | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | Free, open-source | Free, open-source | Tie |
| Learning Curve | 2-3 months | 6-12 months | Idris |
| Integrations | Limited to dependent type systems | Extensive libraries and frameworks | Haskell |
| Scalability | Suitable for small to medium-sized projects | Suitable for large-scale, complex projects | Haskell |
| Support | Active community, limited documentation | Large, established community, extensive documentation | Haskell |
| Dependent Type Features | Built-in support for dependent types, type-level programming | Advanced type system, including generalized algebraic data types (GADTs) | Idris |
| Error Messages | Concise, informative error messages | Sometimes cryptic, requires expertise to decipher | Idris |

## When to Choose Idris
* If you're a 10-person research team with a limited budget, Idris provides a cost-effective solution for exploring dependent types without sacrificing performance.
* When working on a small to medium-sized project with simple dependencies, Idris's ease of use and minimal setup make it an attractive choice.
* For proof-of-concept or prototype development, Idris's rapid development capabilities and concise error messages reduce the time spent on debugging.
* If you're already familiar with functional programming concepts, Idris's syntax and semantics will feel more intuitive, allowing you to focus on dependent type development.

## When to Choose Haskell
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company with a large codebase and complex dependencies, Haskell's scalability and extensive library support ensure your project can handle the demands of a large user base.
* When working on a project that requires advanced type-level programming, Haskell's generalized algebraic data types (GADTs) and type families provide a more comprehensive set of features.
* For teams already invested in the Haskell ecosystem, the extensive documentation, and large community make it easier to find resources and expertise.
* If you're developing a critical system that requires high reliability and maintainability, Haskell's strong type system and rigorous testing capabilities provide a solid foundation.

## Real-World Use Case: Dependent Types
Suppose we're building a proof assistant for formal verification of software protocols. We need to implement a dependent type system to ensure the correctness of our proofs.
* Setup complexity: Idris requires 2-3 days to set up a basic dependent type system, while Haskell requires 1-2 weeks due to its more complex type system.
* Ongoing maintenance burden: Idris requires less maintenance effort, with an estimated 5 hours per month, whereas Haskell requires around 10-15 hours per month due to its more extensive feature set.
* Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions: Idris costs approximately $500 per month for hosting and maintenance, while Haskell costs around $2,000 per month due to the need for more powerful hardware and additional support.
* Common gotchas: In Idris, be aware of the limited support for certain type-level programming features, while in Haskell, be prepared to invest time in understanding the complex type system and its many extensions.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Idris and Haskell:
* Data export/import limitations: Idris has limited support for exporting dependent type definitions, while Haskell's extensive libraries make it easier to import and export data.
* Training time needed: When migrating from Idris to Haskell, expect to spend an additional 2-3 months training your team on Haskell's unique features and syntax.
* Hidden costs: When switching to Haskell, be prepared for increased hardware costs due to the more demanding nature of the language.

## FAQ
Q: What is the main difference between Idris and Haskell's dependent type systems?
A: Idris has built-in support for dependent types, while Haskell's dependent type system is based on generalized algebraic data types (GADTs) and type families.

Q: Can I use both Idris and Haskell together?
A: Yes, you can use Idris for dependent type development and Haskell for other aspects of your project, but be aware of the potential integration challenges and additional complexity.

Q: Which has better ROI for Dependent Types?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, Idris provides a better ROI for small to medium-sized projects, with estimated cost savings of 30-40% compared to Haskell. However, for large-scale projects, Haskell's scalability and extensive library support may provide a better ROI in the long run.

---
**Bottom Line:** For dependent type development, Idris is the better choice for small to medium-sized projects or teams with limited budgets, while Haskell is more suitable for large-scale, complex projects or teams already invested in the Haskell ecosystem.
