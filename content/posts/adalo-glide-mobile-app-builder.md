## Real-World Use Case: Mobile App Builder
Let's say you're building a mobile app for a small business with 100 users, and you need to manage user data, orders, and inventory. With Adalo, setup complexity is around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $100-$200 per month, depending on the features you need. Common gotchas include the 100,000 record limit in Adalo's built-in database and potential integration issues with external tools. With Glide, setup complexity is around 1-2 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is also relatively low. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $25-$100 per month, depending on the features you need.
