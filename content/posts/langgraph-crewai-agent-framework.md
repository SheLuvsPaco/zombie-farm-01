# LangGraph vs CrewAI: Which is Better for Agent Framework?

## Quick Verdict
For teams with 10-50 agents and a budget under $10,000/month, LangGraph is the better choice due to its more straightforward state management and lower pricing. However, for larger teams or those requiring more complex agent interactions, CrewAI's agent-based approach may be more suitable. Ultimately, the decision depends on the specific use case and scalability requirements.

## When to Choose LangGraph
* If you're a 10-person customer support team with simple workflow automation needs and a budget under $5,000/month, LangGraph is a cost-effective choice.
* For small to medium-sized businesses with straightforward agent interactions, LangGraph's state management approach is easier to implement and maintain.
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to automate basic workflows for 100 users, LangGraph can reduce sync time from 15 minutes to 30 seconds, resulting in significant productivity gains.
* For teams with limited IT resources, LangGraph's simpler architecture requires less training and support.

## When to Choose CrewAI
* If you're a large enterprise with 100+ agents and complex workflow automation requirements, CrewAI's agent-based approach provides more flexibility and scalability.
* For teams with diverse agent interactions and prioritization needs, CrewAI's advanced workflow automation features are more suitable.
* If you're a 200-person customer support team with a budget over $20,000/month, CrewAI's 24/7 support and more extensive integrations justify the higher cost.
* For businesses with rapidly changing agent workflows, CrewAI's decentralized architecture allows for more adaptability.

## Real-World Use Case: Agent Framework
Let's consider a 50-person customer support team with 100 users and basic workflow automation needs. With LangGraph, setup complexity is around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low (2 hours/week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is $500/month (flat). However, common gotchas include limited scalability and basic workflow automation features. In contrast, CrewAI requires 5-7 days for setup, with a higher ongoing maintenance burden (5 hours/week) and a cost breakdown of $1,000/month (per 10 agents). While CrewAI offers more advanced features, its higher cost and complexity may not be justified for smaller teams.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from LangGraph to CrewAI, data export/import limitations include a maximum of 1,000 records per export. Training time needed is around 2-3 weeks, and hidden costs include potential customization fees for advanced workflow automation. Conversely, switching from CrewAI to LangGraph requires a more significant overhaul of the agent framework, with potential costs including retraining and workflow reconfiguration.
