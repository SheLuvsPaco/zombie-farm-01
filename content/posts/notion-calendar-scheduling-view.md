# Does Notion Have Calendar? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Notion does not have a traditional calendar view, but it offers a Timeline view that can be used for scheduling purposes. This Timeline view allows users to visualize and organize their tasks and events in a linear timeline, which can be a suitable alternative to a traditional calendar.

## How to Use Calendar in Notion (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the page where you want to create a timeline view.
2. Click on the "Add a template" button and select "Timeline" from the available options.
3. Result: A new timeline view will be created, where you can add tasks and events, and customize the layout to suit your scheduling needs.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Notion doesn't support a traditional calendar view natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Google Calendar or Apple Calendar using Notion's integration features, allowing you to sync your events and tasks.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Calendar by Notion, which provides a more traditional calendar interface within Notion.
3. **The "Hack":** Create a custom table with date columns and use Notion's filtering and sorting features to create a makeshift calendar view, although this requires more manual setup and maintenance.

## Better Alternatives for Calendar
If Calendar is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Scheduling View), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Trello (Native support) - offers a calendar power-up that allows users to view their boards as a calendar.
- **Alternative 2:** Asana (Better implementation) - provides a built-in calendar view that allows users to schedule tasks and events, with features like drag-and-drop functionality and integration with Google Calendar.

## FAQ
Q: Is Calendar coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Notion's public roadmap, there are no plans to add a traditional calendar view, but the company is continuously improving the Timeline view and exploring new ways to enhance scheduling capabilities.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, the Timeline view is available on all Notion plans, including the free plan, so users can take advantage of this feature regardless of their pricing tier.
