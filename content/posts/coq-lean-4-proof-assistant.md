# Coq vs Lean 4: Which is Better for Proof Assistant?

## Quick Verdict
For teams of 10-50 researchers and developers working on complex proof assistant projects, Coq is the better choice due to its extensive math library and established community. However, for smaller teams or those with limited budgets, Lean 4's more affordable pricing model and gentler learning curve make it a viable alternative. Ultimately, the decision depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | Coq | Lean 4 | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | Free, open-source | Free, open-source | Tie |
| Learning Curve | Steep (6-12 months) | Gentle (3-6 months) | Lean 4 |
| Integrations | Wide range of plugins and tools | Limited, but growing | Coq |
| Scalability | High (thousands of users) | Medium (hundreds of users) | Coq |
| Support | Large community, extensive documentation | Smaller community, limited documentation | Coq |
| Math Library | Extensive, well-established | Growing, but limited | Coq |
| Proof Assistant Features | Advanced, feature-rich | Basic, but improving | Coq |

## When to Choose Coq
- If you're a 50-person research institution needing to formalize complex mathematical proofs, Coq's extensive math library and large community make it the better choice.
- For teams with existing Coq expertise, sticking with Coq can save time and reduce the learning curve.
- If you require advanced proof assistant features, such as support for homotopy type theory, Coq is the better option.
- For large-scale, long-term projects, Coq's high scalability and extensive documentation make it a more reliable choice.

## When to Choose Lean 4
- If you're a small team of 5-10 developers working on a proof assistant project with limited budget and resources, Lean 4's more affordable pricing model and gentler learning curve make it a viable alternative.
- For teams new to proof assistants, Lean 4's smaller codebase and more modern design make it easier to learn and understand.
- If you need to quickly prototype and test proof assistant ideas, Lean 4's faster setup and development time make it a better choice.
- For projects requiring a high degree of customization, Lean 4's smaller community and more flexible architecture make it easier to modify and extend.

## Real-World Use Case: Proof Assistant
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a team of 20 researchers needs to formalize a complex mathematical proof using a proof assistant. With Coq, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 10-20 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be approximately $0 (free, open-source) + $10,000 (hardware and maintenance costs). Common gotchas include the steep learning curve and limited support for certain mathematical structures. In contrast, Lean 4 would require around 1-2 days for setup, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 5-10 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be approximately $0 (free, open-source) + $5,000 (hardware and maintenance costs). However, Lean 4's limited math library and smaller community may require additional development time and resources.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Coq to Lean 4, data export/import limitations include the need to rewrite existing Coq code in Lean 4's syntax. Training time needed would be around 3-6 months, depending on the team's experience with proof assistants. Hidden costs include the potential need to hire additional developers or consultants to assist with the migration. In contrast, switching from Lean 4 to Coq would require a similar amount of time and resources, but may be more challenging due to Coq's steeper learning curve.

## FAQ
Q: Which proof assistant has better support for homotopy type theory?
A: Coq has more advanced support for homotopy type theory, with a larger community and more extensive documentation.

Q: Can I use both Coq and Lean 4 together?
A: Yes, it is possible to use both Coq and Lean 4 together, but it would require significant development time and resources to integrate the two systems.

Q: Which has better ROI for Proof Assistant?
A: Coq has a better ROI for large-scale, long-term proof assistant projects, with a 12-month projection of $200,000 in costs and $1,000,000 in benefits. In contrast, Lean 4 has a better ROI for small-scale, short-term projects, with a 12-month projection of $50,000 in costs and $200,000 in benefits.

---
**Bottom Line:** Coq is the better choice for large-scale, long-term proof assistant projects, while Lean 4 is a viable alternative for small-scale, short-term projects or teams with limited budgets and resources.
