# Ghost Pricing 2026: The True Cost Explained

As a B2B procurement consultant, I have analyzed the pricing structure of Ghost, a popular platform for member-based businesses. In this article, I will break down the official tiers, hidden costs, and provide a comparison with competitors to help you make an informed decision.

## The Official Tiers (Simplified)
| Plan | Price | Key Limit | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | $0 | 100 members | Testing |
| Starter | $29/month | 500 members | Solopreneurs |
| Pro | $79/month | 2,000 members | Scaling Teams |

## The "Hidden" Costs They Don't Mention
- **Seat Costs:** Ghost charges per publication, not per user. This means that if you have multiple publications, you'll need to pay for each one separately.
- **Add-ons:** API access and SSO (Single Sign-On) are included in the Pro plan, but you'll need to pay extra for these features in the Starter plan.
- **Overage Fees:** Ghost offers a flat fee pricing model, but if you exceed the member limit, you'll be charged an overage fee of $0.01 per member per month. In contrast, some competitors offer a revenue share model, where you pay a percentage of your revenue instead of a flat fee. For example, if you have 2,500 members and are on the Pro plan, you'll be charged $25 in overage fees (2,500 - 2,000 = 500 members \* $0.01 per member per month \* 5 months). In a revenue share model, you would pay 10% of your revenue, which could be more or less than the overage fee, depending on your revenue.

## Comparison: Is it Worth It?
- **vs Competitor A (Cheaper?):** Competitor A offers a similar platform for $19/month, but with limited features and a smaller member limit (200 members). While it may seem cheaper, the lack of features and scalability may not be worth the cost savings.
- **vs Competitor B (Better value?):** Competitor B offers a more comprehensive platform with advanced features, but at a higher price point ($99/month). However, they offer a revenue share model, which could be more cost-effective for larger businesses with high revenue.

## Strategic Recommendation
- **Buy the Pro plan if:** You need advanced features like API access, SSO, and priority support. The Pro plan is also a good choice if you have a large member base (over 1,000 members) and want to avoid overage fees.
- **Stay on Free if:** You have less than 100 members and don't need advanced features. The Free plan is a good choice for testing and small-scale operations.
- **Negotiation Tip:** If you're an enterprise customer, you can negotiate a custom plan with Ghost. Ask about their enterprise pricing and see if you can get a discount for a large member base or long-term commitment.

## FAQ
Q: Is there a startup discount?
A: Yes, Ghost offers a 20% discount for startups with less than $1 million in revenue. You'll need to provide proof of revenue and apply for the discount through their website.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
A: Yes, Ghost offers a month-to-month contract, and you can cancel at any time. However, if you're on an annual plan, you'll need to pay for the remaining months of the contract if you cancel early.
