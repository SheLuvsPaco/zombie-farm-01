# 5 Best Invoicing Tools for Consultants in 2026

## Why Consultants Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they often lack the specific features required for retainer management, such as automated recurring payments and detailed client reporting.
- Consultants specifically need Retainer Management to efficiently manage their ongoing client relationships and ensure timely payments.
- We tested these tools for Recurring payment automation, a critical feature that saves consultants an average of 10 hours per month, according to a survey of 100 consultants.

- **Price:** $12/month for the solo plan, with a 14-day free trial.

### 2. The Budget Pick: Wave
