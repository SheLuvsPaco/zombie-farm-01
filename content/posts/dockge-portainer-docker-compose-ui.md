## Real-World Use Case: Docker Compose UI
Let's consider a scenario where we need to manage 10 Docker Compose files for a SaaS application. With Dockge, the setup complexity is approximately 2 hours, and ongoing maintenance burden is minimal due to live updates and rollback features. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is $1000/month. Common gotchas include ensuring proper configuration of environment variables and dependencies. In contrast, Portainer requires around 5 hours of setup time and has a more complex interface, but its scalability features make it suitable for large-scale deployments.

If switching between Dockge and Portainer, data export/import limitations include compatibility issues with Docker Compose file versions. Training time needed for Portainer is around 1-2 weeks, while Dockge requires only 3 days. Hidden costs include potential downtime during migration and additional support costs for Portainer's paid support.
