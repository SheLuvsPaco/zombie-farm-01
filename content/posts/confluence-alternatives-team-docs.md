# 5 Best Confluence Tools for Alternatives in 2026

## Why Alternatives Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they lack the specific features and customization options required for effective team documentation and collaboration.
- Alternatives specifically need Team Docs that can handle complex workflows, multiple users, and large amounts of data.
- We tested these tools for their ability to function as an Enterprise wiki, with a focus on scalability, security, and integration with existing systems.
