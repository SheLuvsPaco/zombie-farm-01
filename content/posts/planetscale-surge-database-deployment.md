* If your company has a large budget and is willing to invest in a customized database deployment solution, PlanetScale's enterprise pricing model may be a better fit.

## When to Choose Surge

## Real-World Use Case: Database Deployment
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person e-commerce company needs to deploy a database with 100,000 products and 10,000 orders per day. With PlanetScale, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 2-3 hours per week. The cost breakdown would be around $1,000 per month for 100 users and 10,000 actions. In contrast, Surge would require around 1-2 days of setup complexity, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week, and a cost breakdown of around $500 per month for 100 users and 10,000 actions. However, PlanetScale's robust branching preview feature would allow for easier testing and validation of database changes, reducing the risk of errors and downtime.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between PlanetScale and Surge, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: PlanetScale supports MySQL and PostgreSQL, while Surge supports MySQL and PostgreSQL, but with limited export/import capabilities.
* Training time needed: PlanetScale requires significant database expertise, while Surge has a more user-friendly interface.
* Hidden costs: PlanetScale's custom pricing model may include additional costs for support, training, and customization, while Surge's flat rate pricing model includes limited support and no customization options.
