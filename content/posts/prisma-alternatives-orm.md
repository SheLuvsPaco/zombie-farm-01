# 5 Best Prisma Tools for Alternatives in 2026

## Why Alternatives Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they often lack the specific features and support required for Prisma alternatives, such as type-safe database capabilities and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) functionality.
- Alternatives specifically need ORM to efficiently interact with databases, ensuring data consistency and reducing the risk of errors.
- We tested these tools for type-safe DB capabilities, focusing on their ability to provide a secure and reliable connection between the application and the database.
