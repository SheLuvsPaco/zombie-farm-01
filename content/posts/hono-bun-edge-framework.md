## Real-World Use Case: Edge Framework
Let's consider a scenario where we need to set up an Edge Framework for a 50-person SaaS company with 1,000 users. With Hono, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $500/month. However, with Bun, the setup complexity would be around 5-7 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 2-3 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $800/month. Common gotchas with Hono include limited scalability and basic routing features, while Bun's more complex setup and higher costs can be a barrier for smaller teams.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Hono and Bun, data export/import limitations include the need to reconfigure routing and caching settings. Training time needed would be around 1-2 weeks for Bun, depending on the team's experience with Edge Frameworks. Hidden costs include potential downtime during the migration process and the need for additional support resources.
