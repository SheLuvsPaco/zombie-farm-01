# Automating Automated Databases: A Guide for Airtable and Make
As a B2B team, integrating Airtable and Make can significantly streamline your database management, reducing manual labor and increasing productivity. This integration enables you to automate backend logic without writing code, resulting in faster data processing and improved accuracy.

## Introduction
The integration of Airtable and Make offers a high return on investment (ROI) for B2B teams by automating database tasks, such as data synchronization and workflow automation. By leveraging the strengths of both platforms, teams can focus on higher-value tasks, leading to increased efficiency and competitiveness.

## Feature Comparison
| Feature | Airtable Capability | Make Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Database Management | Cloud-based database with customizable tables and views | No native database management, but can integrate with various databases |
| Automation | Limited automation capabilities, mainly through Airtable Automations | Robust automation capabilities with a wide range of triggers and actions |
| Integration | Supports integrations with various apps and services through API and webhooks | Supports integrations with over 1,000 apps and services, including Airtable |
| No-Code Backend Logic | Limited no-code backend logic capabilities | Extensive no-code backend logic capabilities with a visual interface |

## Technical Prerequisites
To integrate Airtable and Make, you will need:
* Airtable API key
* Make account with access to the Airtable module
* Webhooks setup in Airtable to trigger Make workflows

## The Workflow
The integration workflow typically follows this 5-step logic flow:
1. Airtable triggers an event, such as a new record being added or updated.
2. The event triggers a webhook in Airtable, which sends a notification to Make.
3. Make receives the notification and triggers a workflow.
4. The Make workflow performs a series of actions, such as data processing, filtering, or synchronization.
5. The workflow outputs the results, which can be sent back to Airtable or other integrated apps.

## Best Practices
When integrating Airtable and Make, it's essential to consider data security and sync frequency. Ensure that your API keys and webhooks are secure, and set up a reasonable sync frequency to avoid overwhelming your systems.

> [!TIP]
> **Pro-Tip:** Use Make's built-in error handling and logging features to monitor and debug your workflows, ensuring that any issues are quickly identified and resolved.
