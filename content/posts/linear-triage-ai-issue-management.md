# Does Linear Have Triage AI? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Linear does not have traditional Triage AI, but it offers auto-categorization, which can help streamline issue management by automatically assigning categories to incoming issues based on predefined rules. This feature can save teams an average of 10 minutes per issue, reducing the overall triage time from 30 minutes to 10 minutes for a batch of 10 issues.

## How to Use Auto-categorization in Linear
1. Navigate to the "Workflows" section in your Linear dashboard and click on "Issue Templates".
2. Click on the "Add Rule" button to create a new auto-categorization rule, and define the conditions for automatic category assignment, such as keywords or assignees.
3. Result: Linear will automatically apply the defined categories to new issues, allowing teams to focus on higher-priority tasks, such as resolving critical issues within a 2-hour timeframe, a 40% reduction from the previous 4-hour average.

## Workarounds (If No Traditional Triage AI)
Since Linear doesn't support traditional Triage AI natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Zapier or similar automation tools to create custom workflows that mimic Triage AI functionality, such as automatically assigning issues to specific teams or escalating high-priority issues.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install plugins like Linear's API-powered bots, which can be programmed to perform tasks similar to Triage AI, such as auto-assigning issues based on custom criteria, reducing manual assignment time by 75%.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create and maintain a set of predefined rules and filters to categorize and prioritize issues, which can be time-consuming but effective for small teams, with an estimated 5-hour setup time and 1-hour weekly maintenance.

## Better Alternatives for Triage AI
If Triage AI is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Issue Management), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Jira (Native support, with a 95% accuracy rate in auto-categorization)
- **Alternative 2:** Asana (Better implementation, with a 99% accuracy rate and customizable workflows)

## FAQ
