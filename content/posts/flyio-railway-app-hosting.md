## Real-World Use Case: App Hosting
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person team needs to host a web application with 100 users and 1,000 actions per day. With Fly.io, setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with ongoing maintenance burden estimated at 5-10 hours per week. The cost breakdown would be approximately $100/month (base plan) + $15/month (transfer fees) = $115/month. With Railway, setup complexity would be around 1-2 days, with ongoing maintenance burden estimated at 2-5 hours per week. The cost breakdown would be approximately $25/month (base plan) + $10/month (transfer fees) = $35/month. However, Railway's limited edge locations and manual scaling may lead to performance issues and increased latency.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Fly.io and Railway, data export/import limitations may apply, and training time needed to adapt to the new platform can range from 1-3 weeks. Hidden costs, such as transfer fees and potential downtime, should also be considered. For example, migrating a 100 GB database from Fly.io to Railway may incur a one-time transfer fee of $10.

## FAQ

A: Yes, you can use both platforms together, but it may require additional configuration and management. For example, you can use Fly.io for edge locations and Railway for core app hosting.

Q: Which has better ROI for App Hosting?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, Railway's lower costs and simpler platform may provide a better ROI for small to medium-sized teams, while Fly.io's advanced features and extensive edge location network may provide a better ROI for larger teams with complex applications.
