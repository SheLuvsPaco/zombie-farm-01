# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manual synchronization between project management boards and calendar events, reducing the risk of missed deadlines and double bookings. By automating this process, teams can save up to 5 hours per week. A common use case is for marketing teams to schedule social media posts and track deadlines on a shared calendar.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Marketing teams scheduling social media posts

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both Trello and Google Calendar

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as which board to sync and the calendar to use

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., "New Card")
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., "Create Event")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Card to Event
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New Card in Trello | Create Event in Google Calendar | Card title and due date synced to Google Calendar event |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Google Calendar events can also be synced back to Trello as new cards, allowing for bidirectional data flow. This is particularly useful for teams that use Google Calendar for scheduling and Trello for project management.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring the card title is mapped to the event title

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers on errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar only syncs cards from a single board, so multiple boards require multiple integrations.
- Google Calendar has a rate limit of 1000 requests per day, so high-volume syncs may be limited.
- The free tier of Trello limits the number of integrations, so teams may need to upgrade for full functionality.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier?
A: The native integration works with the free tier of Trello, but the number of integrations is limited.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for new cards and events, but can be scheduled for every 15 minutes for updates.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced, but it may require a manual backfill process or the use of a third-party service.
