## Real-World Use Case: API Testing
Let's consider a scenario where we need to test 100 APIs with basic authentication. With Bruno, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, and the ongoing maintenance burden would be moderate. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be $0, since Bruno is open-source. However, common gotchas include limited reporting and analytics capabilities.

With Postman, the setup complexity would be around 1-2 days, and the ongoing maintenance burden would be low. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $1,200-$2,500 per month, depending on the commercial plan. Postman's advanced testing features and detailed reporting capabilities make it a better choice for large-scale API testing.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Bruno to Postman, data export/import limitations include the need to manually migrate API collections and environments. Training time needed would be around 1-2 weeks, depending on the team's size and complexity of the migration. Hidden costs include the potential need for additional commercial features or support.
