3. Slack notifies the on-call team members, who receive customizable notifications.
4. Team members can acknowledge or escalate the incident from within Slack.
5. PagerDuty updates the incident status and notifies the team of any changes.

## Best Practices
To ensure a secure and efficient integration, follow these best practices:
* Use secure API access and webhooks to protect sensitive data.
* Set up a sync frequency that balances real-time notifications with system load.

> [!TIP]
> **Pro-Tip:** Use Slack's customizable notification channels to route incident alerts to specific teams or channels, reducing noise and increasing response times.
