# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and contact information between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize lead status updates in real-time, ensuring that both sales and marketing teams have the most up-to-date information.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing lead status updates between HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure data consistency and reduce manual data entry.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, including email, phone number, and company name

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information synchronized between both platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a deal is closed. This bidirectional data flow ensures that both systems have the most current information, reducing errors and improving sales and marketing alignment.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens, ensuring that the correct credentials are used.
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid exceeding API limits.
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, ensuring that all necessary fields are properly configured.

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for prompt intervention and minimizing data inconsistencies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain field types (e.g., multi-select picklists) may not sync between HubSpot and Salesforce.
- **Rate Limits:** Both HubSpot and Salesforce have API rate limits that can affect sync frequency and data transfer volumes.
- **Feature Gaps:** Certain features, such as advanced workflow automation, may not be available in lower-tier plans.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier?
A: No, the integration requires at least a Professional tier HubSpot account and an Enterprise tier Salesforce account.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some actions may be scheduled to occur at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) due to API rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be backfilled during the initial setup, but this may require additional configuration and potentially incur additional costs due to API usage.
