## Real-World Use Case: AI Writing

With Claude, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, with ongoing maintenance burden averaging 2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 20 users would be $2,000 per month. Common gotchas include the need for custom training data and potential tone inconsistencies.
