# Intercom Pricing 2026: The True Cost Explained

As a B2B procurement consultant, I've worked with numerous businesses to optimize their software expenses. In this analysis, we'll delve into the pricing structure of Intercom, a popular customer messaging platform, with a focus on the Resolution Bot costs. Understanding the 'per resolution' model is crucial to making an informed decision.

## The Official Tiers (Simplified)
| Plan | Price | Key Limit | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | $0 | 10 users, 100 contacts | Testing |
| Starter | $74 | 10 users, 1,000 contacts | Solopreneurs |
| Pro | $499 | 10 users, 10,000 contacts | Scaling Teams |

The official pricing tiers provide a clear overview of the costs associated with each plan. However, there are hidden factors that can significantly impact the total cost of ownership.

## The "Hidden" Costs They Don't Mention
- **Seat Costs:** Intercom charges per user, with each additional user costing $19-$39 per month, depending on the plan. This can quickly add up, especially for larger teams.
- **Add-ons:** API access and SSO (Single Sign-On) are available as add-ons, priced at $100-$200 per month. These features are essential for integrating Intercom with other tools and ensuring secure authentication.
- **Overage Fees:** The 'per resolution' model can lead to unexpected costs. For every resolution above the included limit (e.g., 1,000 resolutions on the Starter plan), you'll be charged $0.05-$0.10 per resolution. This can result in significant overage fees if your support volume exceeds expectations. To put this into perspective, if you receive 2,000 support requests per month, you'll incur an additional $50-$100 in overage fees on the Starter plan.

## Comparison: Is it Worth It?
- vs Competitor A (Freshdesk): Freshdesk offers a similar feature set at a lower price point ($19-$49 per user). However, their 'per resolution' model is more restrictive, with higher overage fees ($0.10-$0.20 per resolution).
- vs Competitor B (Zendesk): Zendesk provides a more comprehensive platform with advanced features, but at a higher cost ($49-$199 per user). Their 'per resolution' model is more flexible, with lower overage fees ($0.02-$0.05 per resolution).

## Strategic Recommendation
- **Buy the Pro plan if:** You need advanced features like custom bots, API access, and SSO. The Pro plan offers better value for scaling teams, with a higher resolution limit and lower overage fees.
- **Stay on Free if:** You have less than 100 contacts or 10 users. The Free plan is suitable for small businesses or testing purposes, with minimal support volume.
- **Negotiation Tip:** When purchasing the Enterprise plan, ask about custom pricing and discounts for annual commitments. You can also negotiate additional features or support hours to ensure you're getting the best value for your business.

## FAQ
Q: Is there a startup discount?
A: Yes, Intercom offers a 50% discount for startups with less than $1 million in annual revenue. This discount is available for the first year, and you'll need to provide proof of eligibility.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
A: Intercom offers a monthly or annual contract, with the option to cancel or downgrade at any time. However, if you cancel your annual contract early, you'll be charged a prorated fee for the remaining months. It's essential to review the contract terms before committing to a plan.
