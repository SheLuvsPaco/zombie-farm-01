# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the synchronization of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors. A common use case for this integration is to automatically create new contacts in Salesforce when a lead is generated in HubSpot.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Automating lead generation and contact creation between HubSpot and Salesforce.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger (e.g., "New Form Submission")
3. Set Salesforce as the action (e.g., "Create New Contact")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot form fields to Salesforce contact fields

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Generation
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New form submission in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Automated lead generation and contact creation |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a deal is closed in Salesforce, it can update the corresponding contact in HubSpot.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that all necessary fields are mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by integrating HubSpot or Salesforce with Slack via Zapier or a native integration.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** The integration does not support syncing custom object types in Salesforce.
- **Rate Limits:** HubSpot has a rate limit of 100 requests per 10 seconds for API calls, while Salesforce has a limit of 1,000 API calls per 24 hours for Enterprise tier accounts.
- **Feature Gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot does not support integration with Salesforce, and some features like custom object syncing are only available in higher tiers.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the integration requires at least the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier of HubSpot.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some objects may have scheduled syncs (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, HubSpot and Salesforce support backfilling historical data, but this may require manual configuration and can be subject to rate limits.
