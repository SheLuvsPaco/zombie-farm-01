## Real-World Use Case: LLM API
Let's consider a scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to automate content generation using an LLM API. With Claude 3.5 Sonnet, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $500 per month. However, with GPT-4o, setup complexity would take around 5-7 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 2-3 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $1,000 per month. Common gotchas with Claude 3.5 Sonnet include limited customization options and lower accuracy, while GPT-4o's higher cost and steeper learning curve are potential drawbacks.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between these tools, data export/import limitations are a significant concern. Claude 3.5 Sonnet allows for easy data export, but GPT-4o's data import process can be more complex. Training time needed for GPT-4o is around 2-3 weeks, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet requires minimal training. Hidden costs to consider when migrating to GPT-4o include potential additional support fees and customization costs.
