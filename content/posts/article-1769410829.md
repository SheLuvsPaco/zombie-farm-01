# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with manual data entry and synchronization between the two platforms. This integration automates the process, reducing the time spent on data management and enabling teams to focus on higher-value tasks. 
- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Sales teams can now access up-to-date lead information and interaction history directly within Salesforce, while marketing teams can leverage Salesforce data to create more targeted campaigns in HubSpot.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, including email, phone number, and company name

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information synced between both platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a deal is closed, updating the contact's status in HubSpot to reflect the new sales stage.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, ensuring that all necessary fields (e.g., email, phone) are correctly mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for prompt intervention and minimizing data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom object syncing is not supported in the native integration
- **Rate Limits:** HubSpot limits API calls to 100 per 10 seconds, while Salesforce has its own set of API call limits based on the edition
- **Feature Gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration, and some advanced features like custom object syncing require the Enterprise tier of Salesforce

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need at least the Professional tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some actions may be scheduled to sync every 15 minutes to avoid hitting API rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can backfill historical data from one platform to the other, but this may require manual configuration and could be subject to API rate limits.
