# Does Discord Have Forums? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Discord does not have traditional forums in the classical sense, but it offers community threads that serve a similar purpose, allowing users to engage in organized discussions within specific channels. These threads enable users to create and participate in topic-based conversations, which can be used to mimic some of the functionality of traditional forums.

## How to Use Forums in Discord (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the channel where you want to start a community thread.
2. Click the "+" button next to the chat input field to create a new thread, and select "Create Thread" from the dropdown menu.
3. Result: A new thread will be created, and users can join and participate in the discussion, which will be organized and easily accessible within the channel.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Discord doesn't support traditional forums natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like GitHub or Trello to create external forums or discussion boards that can be linked to your Discord server.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Discord Forum Bot, which can help create and manage forum-like discussions within your server.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create separate channels for different topics and use channel descriptions or pinned messages to provide context and organization, essentially creating a makeshift forum system.

## Better Alternatives for Forums
If traditional forums are a dealbreaker for your workflow (Organized Channels), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Slack (Native support) - Offers a more traditional forum experience through its "Channels" feature.
- **Alternative 2:** Microsoft Teams (Better implementation) - Provides a robust forum system through its "Channels" and "Tabs" features.

## FAQ
Q: Is Forums coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Discord's public roadmap, there are no immediate plans to introduce traditional forums, but the company is continuously working on improving community threads and discussion features.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, community threads are available to all Discord users, regardless of their plan, including the free version. However, some advanced features, like increased thread limits, may be exclusive to the Nitro or Server Boost plans.
