Yes with hierarchy. ClickUp's Goals Tracking feature allows users to set and manage objectives and key results (OKRs) in a hierarchical structure, enabling teams to align their efforts and track progress towards common goals. This feature provides a robust framework for OKR management, enabling users to create goals, break them down into smaller objectives, and assign tasks to team members.

1. Navigate to the "Goals" section in your ClickUp workspace, where you can create new goals and objectives.
