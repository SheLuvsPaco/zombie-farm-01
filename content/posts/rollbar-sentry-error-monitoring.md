## Real-World Use Case: Error Monitoring
Let's say you're a 50-person SaaS company with a medium-sized application, and you need to monitor errors in real-time. With Rollbar, setup complexity is relatively low, taking around 2-3 hours to integrate with your application. Ongoing maintenance burden is also relatively low, requiring around 1-2 hours per week to review and resolve errors. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $600 per month. However, with Sentry, setup complexity is higher, taking around 5-7 hours to integrate with your application, and ongoing maintenance burden is also higher, requiring around 3-5 hours per week to review and resolve errors. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $2,600 per month. Common gotchas with both tools include underestimating the time required for setup and maintenance, as well as not fully utilizing the advanced features available.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Rollbar and Sentry, data export/import limitations are a significant consideration. Rollbar allows for easy export of error data, but Sentry's data export options are more limited. Training time needed to switch between tools is around 2-5 hours, depending on the complexity of your application and the features you're using. Hidden costs to consider include the cost of re-integrating with other tools and the potential need for additional support or consulting services.
