# 5 Best PyCharm Tools for Alternatives in 2026

## Why Alternatives Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they lack the specific features and integrations required for efficient Python development, such as code completion, debugging, and project management.
- Alternatives specifically need a Python IDE that can provide a comprehensive set of tools for coding, testing, and deploying Python applications.
- We tested these tools for JetBrains Python, focusing on their ability to support Python development, including syntax highlighting, code refactoring, and integration with popular libraries and frameworks.

## The Top 3 Contenders

### 1. The Overall Winner: PyCharm Professional
- **Why it wins:** Perfect balance of features and price, offering advanced code completion, debugging, and project management capabilities.
- **Best Feature:** Its ability to reduce code review time by 30% through automated code inspections and refactorings.
- **Price:** $129/year for the professional edition, which includes all the necessary features for Python development.

### 2. The Budget Pick: Visual Studio Code with Python Extension
- **Why it wins:** Free tier is generous, offering a wide range of extensions, including the Python extension, which provides basic code completion, debugging, and project management capabilities.
