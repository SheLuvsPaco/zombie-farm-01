# Does Notion Have Offline Mode? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Notion offers partial support for offline mode through caching, allowing users to access and edit some content without an internet connection, but it has limitations such as caching only a certain amount of data and not supporting all features. This means that while you can use Notion offline to some extent, the experience is not fully functional and may not meet all your needs, especially for complex workflows or large databases.

## How to Use Offline Mode in Notion
1. Navigate to your Notion workspace on your desktop or mobile app while connected to the internet to ensure your data is cached.
2. Once your data is cached, you can disconnect from the internet and continue working on your Notion pages, but be aware that only cached data will be accessible.
3. Result: You can edit and create new pages based on the cached data, but any changes will only sync once you reconnect to the internet, and some features like searching the full database or accessing uncached pages will not work.

## Workarounds
Since Notion's offline mode has limitations, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Google Drive or other cloud storage services to manually save and access your Notion pages as PDFs or markdown files, allowing you to work on them offline in another app.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install plugins like Offline Notion or similar tools that claim to enhance offline capabilities, but be cautious of their limitations and potential security risks.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually export your Notion pages as PDFs or markdown files before a flight, work on them in another app like a text editor, and then manually import the changes back into Notion once you have internet access, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

## Better Alternatives for Offline Mode
If Offline Mode is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Working on flights), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Evernote (Native support with a more comprehensive offline mode that allows full access to notes and notebooks without an internet connection).
- **Alternative 2:** OneNote (Better implementation with seamless offline syncing and a more robust set of features available offline).

## FAQ
Q: Is Offline Mode coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Notion's public roadmap, there are plans to improve offline capabilities, but no specific timeline has been announced, and the details of what these improvements will entail are not yet clear.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Notion's current offline mode capabilities are available to all users, regardless of their pricing plan, but the effectiveness and extent of these capabilities can vary based on the size of your workspace and the specific features you use.
