# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with data silos and manual data entry. By connecting these two tools, teams can automate lead tracking, contact management, and sales pipeline updates, reducing the risk of human error and freeing up more time for strategic activities. 
- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Streamlining lead nurturing and sales handoff processes for a mid-sized B2B company.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited edition)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or Make
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app (e.g., "New contact created")
3. Set Salesforce as the action app (e.g., "Create new contact")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as email address, phone number, and company name

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Nurturing
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New form submission in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Automated lead assignment to sales reps |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, you can also set up a workflow where updates made in Salesforce (e.g., lead status changes) are synced back to HubSpot, ensuring that both systems have the most up-to-date information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens, ensuring that your credentials are correct and not expired.
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid hitting API rate limits.
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping to ensure that all necessary fields are properly mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce.

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing you to quickly investigate and resolve issues before they impact your sales and marketing workflows.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain advanced data types may not sync between HubSpot and Salesforce.
- **Rate Limits:** Both HubSpot and Salesforce have API rate limits that can impact sync frequency and volume.
- **Feature Gaps:** Certain features, such as advanced reporting and analytics, may not be available in lower-tier plans.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the integration requires at least a Marketing Hub or Sales Hub subscription.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some syncs may be scheduled (e.g., every 15 minutes) due to API rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can backfill historical data from one system to the other, but this may require additional setup and configuration.
