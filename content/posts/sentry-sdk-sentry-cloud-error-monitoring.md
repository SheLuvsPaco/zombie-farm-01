# Sentry SDK vs Sentry Cloud: Which is Better for Error Monitoring?

## Quick Verdict
For small to medium-sized teams with limited budget and simple error monitoring needs, Sentry SDK is a cost-effective solution. However, for larger teams or those requiring more advanced features and support, Sentry Cloud is the better choice. Ultimately, the decision comes down to your team's specific needs and resources.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | Sentry SDK | Sentry Cloud | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | One-time payment, self-hosted | Subscription-based, managed | Sentry SDK (for small teams) |
| Learning Curve | Steeper, requires technical expertise | Gentler, user-friendly interface | Sentry Cloud |
| Integrations | Limited to 10 pre-built integrations | Over 50 pre-built integrations | Sentry Cloud |
| Scalability | Limited to self-hosted infrastructure | Automatically scales with usage | Sentry Cloud |
| Support | Community-driven, limited support | Priority support, 24/7 availability | Sentry Cloud |
| Error Monitoring Features | Basic error tracking, limited filtering | Advanced error tracking, filtering, and analytics | Sentry Cloud |
| Data Retention | Limited to 30 days, self-hosted | Up to 1 year, managed | Sentry Cloud |

## When to Choose Sentry SDK
* If you're a 10-person startup with a simple error monitoring setup and limited budget, Sentry SDK can provide a cost-effective solution.
* If your team has extensive technical expertise and prefers a self-hosted solution, Sentry SDK can be a good choice.
* If you're working on a small, internal project with limited error monitoring needs, Sentry SDK can provide the necessary features.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing basic error tracking for a small application, Sentry SDK can be a suitable option, with a one-time payment of $500 and limited maintenance requirements.

## When to Choose Sentry Cloud
* If you're a large enterprise with complex error monitoring needs and require advanced features, Sentry Cloud is the better choice.
* If your team lacks technical expertise or prefers a managed solution, Sentry Cloud provides a user-friendly interface and priority support.
* If you're working on a large-scale project with multiple integrations and require automatic scaling, Sentry Cloud is the way to go.
* For instance, if you're a 500-person e-commerce company needing advanced error tracking and analytics for a high-traffic website, Sentry Cloud can provide the necessary features, with a subscription-based pricing model starting at $150 per month.

## Real-World Use Case: Error Monitoring
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 100-person team needs to set up error monitoring for a web application. With Sentry SDK, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be a one-time payment of $1,000. In contrast, Sentry Cloud would require a setup time of 1-2 hours, with minimal ongoing maintenance. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be $300 per month. However, Sentry Cloud provides more advanced features, such as automatic scaling and priority support, which can be crucial for large teams.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Sentry SDK to Sentry Cloud, data export/import limitations may apply, with a maximum of 100,000 events per export. Training time needed for the new platform would be around 1-2 weeks, depending on the team's technical expertise. Hidden costs may include additional fees for data storage and retention. On the other hand, switching from Sentry Cloud to Sentry SDK would require a significant upfront investment in self-hosted infrastructure and technical expertise.
