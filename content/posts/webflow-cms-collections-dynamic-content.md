# Does Webflow Have CMS Collections? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Up to 10000 items. Webflow's CMS Collections allow users to create and manage dynamic content, with a limit of 10,000 items per collection, making it suitable for most small to medium-sized projects. However, for larger projects or those requiring more complex content management, users may need to explore workarounds or alternative solutions.

## How to Use CMS Collections in Webflow (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the Webflow dashboard and click on the "CMS" tab to access the Collections page.
2. Click on the "Create a Collection" button to set up a new collection, then define the collection's structure by adding fields such as text, images, or references to other collections.
3. Result: Once the collection is set up, you can start adding items to it, and Webflow will automatically generate a dynamic content page that can be used to display the collection's items, with options for filtering, sorting, and pagination.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Webflow's native CMS Collections have limitations, such as the 10,000 item limit, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Airtable or other external databases to manage larger datasets and sync them with Webflow.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install plugins like CMS Booster or Collection Manager to extend the functionality of Webflow's CMS Collections.
3. **The "Hack":** Use Webflow's API to create a custom solution for managing large datasets, which requires development expertise and may incur additional costs.

## Better Alternatives for CMS Collections
If CMS Collections is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Dynamic Content), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Ghost (Native support) - a simple, open-source platform for creating and managing dynamic content.
- **Alternative 2:** Strapi (Better implementation) - a headless CMS that provides a more robust and scalable solution for managing large datasets.

## FAQ
Q: Is CMS Collections coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Webflow's public roadmap, they are planning to improve and expand their CMS capabilities, but no specific details on CMS Collections have been announced.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Webflow's CMS Collections are available on all plans, including the basic plan, with the same 10,000 item limit applying to all plans. However, enterprise plans may offer additional support and customization options for larger projects.
