# Does Figma Have AI Design? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Figma offers text-to-design features, which enable users to generate UI designs using natural language inputs, streamlining the design process. However, the current implementation has limitations, such as requiring specific prompts and lacking full customization options, which may not fully replace traditional design workflows.

## How to Use AI Design in Figma
1. Navigate to the Figma toolbar and click on the "Design" tab, then select "Text-to-Design" from the dropdown menu.
2. Click on the "Generate Design" button and enter a descriptive text prompt, such as "Create a login screen with a blue background and white text."
3. Result: Figma's AI algorithm will generate a design based on the input prompt, which can then be refined and customized as needed, reducing the initial design time from 30 minutes to approximately 5 minutes.

## Workarounds (Not Applicable)
Since Figma does support text-to-design features natively, there is no need for workarounds. However, for more advanced AI design capabilities, users may still explore integrations or third-party plugins to enhance their workflow.

## Better Alternatives for AI Design
If Figma's text-to-design features are not sufficient for your workflow (UI Generation), these tools have more advanced AI design capabilities built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Adobe XD (Native support with more extensive customization options)
- **Alternative 2:** Sketch (Better implementation with more advanced AI-powered design assistants)

## FAQ
Q: Is AI Design coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Figma's public roadmap, they plan to expand and improve their text-to-design features, including more advanced AI capabilities, but no specific release date has been announced.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Figma's text-to-design features are available on all plans, including the free tier, with no limitations on usage, making it accessible to designers of all levels and budgets.
