# Does Zoom Have Recording Alert? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Always notifies for legal compliance. Zoom provides a recording alert feature that notifies all participants when a meeting is being recorded, ensuring transparency and compliance with privacy laws. This feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled by the host, providing a clear indication to participants that their audio and video are being recorded.

## How to Use Recording Alert in Zoom
1. Navigate to the Zoom meeting settings before starting the meeting.
2. Click on the "Record" button to initiate the recording, and Zoom will automatically display a notification to all participants.
3. Result: A clear alert will be displayed on the screen of all participants, indicating that the meeting is being recorded, along with an audio announcement.

## Workarounds (Not Applicable)
Since Zoom natively supports recording alerts, there is no need for workarounds or third-party integrations to achieve this functionality.

If you're evaluating alternatives to Zoom for recording alert functionality (although Zoom already meets this requirement), other tools with robust recording features include:
- **Alternative 1:** Google Meet (Native support with clear notifications)
- **Alternative 2:** Microsoft Teams (Comprehensive meeting recording features with alerts)
