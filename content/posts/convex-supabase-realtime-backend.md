# Convex vs Supabase: Which is Better for Realtime Backend?

## Quick Verdict
For small to medium-sized teams with a budget under $10,000 per month, Convex is a better choice for Realtime Backend due to its simpler pricing model and more intuitive learning curve. However, larger teams with more complex requirements may prefer Supabase for its greater scalability and customization options. Ultimately, the choice between Convex and Supabase depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.

## When to Choose Convex
* If you're a 10-person startup with a simple Realtime Backend requirement and a budget under $5,000 per month, Convex is a more cost-effective option.
* If you prioritize ease of use and a simple learning curve, Convex is a better choice, with most developers able to set up a basic project in under 3 days.
* If you need to handle a small to medium-sized user base (less than 10,000 concurrent connections) and prioritize automatic caching for reactive queries, Convex is a better fit.
* For example, if you're a 20-person SaaS company needing to build a simple chat application with Realtime Backend, Convex can help you get started quickly and efficiently.

## When to Choose Supabase
* If you're a 50-person enterprise with a complex Realtime Backend requirement and a budget over $10,000 per month, Supabase is a more scalable option.
* If you prioritize customization and control over your Realtime Backend, Supabase offers more advanced features and configuration options.
* If you need to handle a large user base (over 10,000 concurrent connections) and prioritize priority support, Supabase is a better choice.
* For instance, if you're a 100-person e-commerce company needing to build a complex Realtime Backend with multiple integrations and custom caching, Supabase can provide the necessary scalability and support.

## Real-World Use Case: Realtime Backend
Let's consider a Realtime Backend use case where we need to build a simple chat application with 100 concurrent users. With Convex, setup complexity is around 2-3 hours, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $50 per month. However, with Supabase, setup complexity is around 5-7 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is higher due to manual caching requirements. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $25 per month for the free plan, but would increase to $100 per month for the paid plan with priority support. Common gotchas include handling connection limits and optimizing query performance.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Convex and Supabase, data export/import limitations include a maximum of 100,000 rows per export. Training time needed to learn the new platform would be around 3-7 days. Hidden costs include potential increases in query costs due to differences in pricing models.

## FAQ
Q: Which platform has better support for reactive queries?
A: Convex has better support for reactive queries with automatic caching, while Supabase requires manual caching.

Q: Can I use both Convex and Supabase together?
A: Yes, you can use both platforms together, but it would require custom integration and may increase complexity and costs.

Q: Which platform has better ROI for Realtime Backend?
A: Convex has a better ROI for small to medium-sized teams with simple Realtime Backend requirements, with a projected 12-month cost savings of 20-30% compared to Supabase.

---
**Bottom Line:** Convex is a better choice for small to medium-sized teams with simple Realtime Backend requirements, while Supabase is a better choice for larger teams with more complex requirements and a need for greater scalability and customization.
