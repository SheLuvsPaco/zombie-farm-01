# Thanos vs Cortex: Which is Better for Metrics?

## Quick Verdict
For teams with large-scale metrics storage needs, Thanos is the better choice due to its cost-effective and scalable long-term storage capabilities. However, for smaller teams or those with simpler metrics requirements, Cortex may be a more suitable option due to its ease of use and lower upfront costs. Ultimately, the decision depends on the team's specific needs and budget.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | Thanos | Cortex | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | Open-source, free | Subscription-based, $10/user/month | Thanos |
| Learning Curve | Steep, requires expertise | Gentle, user-friendly | Cortex |
| Integrations | Supports Prometheus, Grafana | Supports Prometheus, Grafana, and more | Cortex |
| Scalability | Highly scalable, handles large datasets | Scalable, but may require additional resources | Thanos |
| Support | Community-driven, limited support | Commercial support available | Cortex |
| Metrics Storage | Long-term storage, up to 10 years | Short-term storage, up to 30 days | Thanos |
| Query Performance | Fast query performance, <1s | Fast query performance, <1s | Tie |

## When to Choose Thanos
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to store large amounts of metrics data for compliance or auditing purposes, Thanos is a cost-effective solution that can handle long-term storage.
* If you have a team of experienced engineers who can handle the complexity of Thanos, it's a good choice for large-scale metrics storage.
* If you're working with a limited budget and need a free, open-source solution for metrics storage, Thanos is a viable option.
* If you require high scalability and can handle the setup complexity, Thanos is a good choice for handling large datasets.

## When to Choose Cortex
* If you're a small team or startup with simple metrics requirements, Cortex is a user-friendly and easy-to-use solution that requires minimal setup.
* If you're willing to pay a premium for commercial support and a gentle learning curve, Cortex is a good choice for teams who need help with metrics storage.
* If you're working with a small to medium-sized dataset and don't require long-term storage, Cortex is a suitable option.
* If you need a solution that integrates with a wide range of tools and platforms, Cortex is a good choice due to its extensive integration capabilities.

## Real-World Use Case: Metrics
Let's consider a scenario where a 100-person e-commerce company needs to store metrics data for 100 users and 100 actions. With Thanos, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown would be $0 for the open-source software, but $5,000 for hardware and maintenance costs. With Cortex, the setup complexity would be around 1-2 hours, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 30 minutes per week. The cost breakdown would be $10,000 per year for the subscription-based service. Common gotchas include data retention policies and query performance optimization.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Cortex to Thanos, data export/import limitations include the need to re-index and re-store data, which can take around 1-2 weeks. Training time needed would be around 2-3 days, and hidden costs include the need for additional hardware and maintenance resources. If switching from Thanos to Cortex, data export/import limitations include the need to re-format and re-upload data, which can take around 1-2 days. Training time needed would be around 1-2 hours, and hidden costs include the need for commercial support and potential data loss during migration.

## FAQ
Q: What is the main difference between Thanos and Cortex for metrics storage?
A: The main difference is that Thanos offers long-term storage capabilities, up to 10 years, while Cortex offers short-term storage, up to 30 days.

Q: Can I use both Thanos and Cortex together?
A: Yes, you can use both tools together, but it would require significant setup and maintenance efforts. It's recommended to use Thanos for long-term storage and Cortex for short-term storage and querying.

Q: Which has better ROI for Metrics?
A: Thanos has a better ROI for metrics storage due to its cost-effective and scalable long-term storage capabilities. With a 12-month projection, Thanos can save a team around $10,000 per year compared to Cortex.

---
**Bottom Line:** Thanos is the better choice for teams with large-scale metrics storage needs due to its cost-effective and scalable long-term storage capabilities, but Cortex is a more suitable option for smaller teams or those with simpler metrics requirements due to its ease of use and lower upfront costs.
