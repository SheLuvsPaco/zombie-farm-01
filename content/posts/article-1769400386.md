# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the synchronization of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors. A common use case for this integration is to automatically create new contacts in Salesforce when a lead is generated in HubSpot.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Automating lead generation and contact creation between HubSpot and Salesforce

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger (e.g., "New Contact")
3. Set Salesforce as the action (e.g., "Create New Contact")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot's "Email" field to Salesforce's "Email" field

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Generation
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New form submission in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Automated lead generation and contact creation |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a deal is closed in Salesforce, it can update the corresponding contact in HubSpot to reflect the new status.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the "Company" field is mapped correctly

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers on errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- HubSpot's free tier does not support Salesforce integration
- Salesforce has rate limits on API calls, which can impact sync frequency
- The native integration does not support syncing custom objects

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need at least the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some objects may have scheduled syncs (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data, but it may require a one-time backfill process, which can take several hours or days depending on the amount of data.
