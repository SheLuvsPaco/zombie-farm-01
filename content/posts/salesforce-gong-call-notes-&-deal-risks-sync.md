5. The sales team reviews the updated pipeline and takes necessary actions based on the call notes and deal risks.

## Best Practices

- Use secure authentication methods (OAuth or JWT) for API access.
- Set up webhooks for real-time data sync to minimize latency.
- Schedule regular data backups to prevent data loss.
