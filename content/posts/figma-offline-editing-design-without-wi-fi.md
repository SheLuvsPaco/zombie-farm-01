# Does Figma Have Offline Editing? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Figma does offer some offline editing capabilities, but with limited functionality compared to its online mode, and significantly less robust than what Sketch provides. This means that while you can make some edits without an internet connection, the full range of features and real-time collaboration capabilities are not available offline, limiting its usefulness in design workflows that require constant connectivity.

## How to Use Offline Editing in Figma
1. Navigate to your Figma project while you have an internet connection to ensure it is synced and available for offline access.
2. Click on the project you wish to edit offline; Figma will allow you to make certain edits without a connection, such as modifying text or adjusting elements.
3. Result: Your changes will be synced to the cloud the next time you connect to the internet, but be aware that more complex operations or collaborations may not work as expected or at all without a stable internet connection.

## Workarounds
Since Figma's offline editing is limited, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Google Drive or other cloud storage services to manually save and manage versions of your files, though this doesn't enable real-time offline collaboration.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install plugins like AutoSave or Figmatic to enhance your offline experience, though these may not fully replicate the offline capabilities of other design tools.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually export your designs as images or PDFs before going offline, make annotations or adjustments externally, and then re-import them into Figma once you're back online, which is cumbersome and not ideal for iterative design processes.

## Better Alternatives for Offline Editing
If Offline Editing is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Design without Wi-Fi), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Sketch (Native support) - Offers more comprehensive offline editing capabilities, making it a better choice for designers who frequently work without internet access.
- **Alternative 2:** Adobe XD (Better implementation) - Provides a more seamless offline experience, with the ability to work on designs, make changes, and then sync them once you're back online, making it suitable for a wide range of design tasks.

## FAQ
Q: Is Offline Editing coming in the roadmap?
A: As of the last public update from Figma, there are plans to enhance offline capabilities, but no specific timeline has been announced, leaving users to rely on current workarounds or alternative tools for more robust offline design needs.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Figma's offline editing capabilities are available across all plans, including the free version, though the limitations apply uniformly, meaning that even enterprise users face the same restrictions in terms of offline functionality.
