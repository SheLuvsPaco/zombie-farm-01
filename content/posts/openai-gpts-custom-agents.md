# Does OpenAI Have GPTs? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
OpenAI does have GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) that can be utilized for bot creation, allowing developers to build custom agents with advanced language understanding capabilities. However, the extent of GPT integration and accessibility may vary depending on the specific use case and the user's plan, with more advanced features available in higher-tier plans.

## How to Use GPTs in OpenAI (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the OpenAI dashboard and select the "Models" section, where you can choose from a variety of pre-trained GPT models tailored for different tasks, such as text generation or conversation.
2. Click on the "Create" button to start building your custom agent, and then select the GPT model that best fits your needs, configuring it as necessary for your specific application.
3. Result: Your custom agent, powered by OpenAI's GPT, can now generate human-like text, answer questions, or engage in conversations, with the potential to significantly enhance user experience and automate tasks, such as reducing response times from 5 minutes to under 1 minute.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since this scenario assumes OpenAI does have GPTs, workarounds are not necessary in this context. However, for completeness and in case of future changes or limitations, potential workarounds could include:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a third-party service that offers GPT capabilities, such as Hugging Face, to leverage their models within your custom agent.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Transformers to access a broader range of pre-trained models, including GPTs, directly within your development environment.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually implement a GPT model from scratch or use an open-source alternative, requiring significant development time and expertise, and potentially leading to a 3-6 month development cycle versus using pre-existing solutions.

## Better Alternatives for GPTs
If GPTs is a critical feature for your workflow (Custom Agents) and you find OpenAI's implementation lacking, these tools have robust GPT support built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services (Native support) offers a comprehensive set of AI services, including advanced language models similar to GPTs, with a free tier available for limited use cases.
- **Alternative 2:** Google Cloud AI Platform (Better implementation) provides a more extensive range of pre-trained models and a more flexible pricing structure, suitable for large-scale custom agent deployments, with costs starting at $0.006 per hour.

## FAQ
Q: Is GPTs coming in the roadmap?
A: OpenAI has consistently updated its model lineup, including improvements to GPT models, with the latest version (GPT-4) announced in early 2023, indicating a commitment to enhancing language generation capabilities.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: While basic access to GPT models is available across various plans, including the free tier with limitations (e.g., 10,000 tokens per month), more advanced features, larger model sizes, and higher usage limits are indeed gated to higher-tier plans, including the Enterprise plan, which offers custom pricing based on specific needs, such as over 100,000 tokens per month.
