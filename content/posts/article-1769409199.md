# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manually updating calendars with task deadlines and due dates. This integration automates the process, ensuring that team members and stakeholders have a unified view of project timelines. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Managing project deadlines and scheduling team meetings.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both Trello and Google Calendar

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as mapping Trello boards to Google Calendar events

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., "New Card Added")
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., "Create New Event")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Trello to Google Calendar
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New Card Added in Trello | Create New Event in Google Calendar | Trello card due dates are synced to Google Calendar events |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Google Calendar events can also be synced back to Trello, allowing for bidirectional data flow. For example, when an event is updated in Google Calendar, the corresponding Trello card can be updated with the new event details.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the Trello card due date is mapped to the Google Calendar event date

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap/Scenario that triggers on sync errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar only supports syncing of due dates, not start dates.
- Google Calendar has a rate limit of 1000 requests per day, which can be exceeded if syncing a large number of Trello cards.
- The free tier of Trello has limited integration capabilities, while the paid tier offers more advanced features, such as custom field mapping.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of Trello?
A: Yes, but with limited integration capabilities. The paid tier offers more advanced features.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to avoid exceeding rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, Trello's native integration with Google Calendar allows for backfilling of historical data, but this may be subject to rate limits.
