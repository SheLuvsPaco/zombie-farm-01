## FAQ
Q: Do I really need a dedicated Nhost?
A: Yes, a dedicated Nhost can provide a significant return on investment (ROI) by reducing development time, improving data management, and increasing scalability. For example, a dedicated Nhost can reduce sync time from 15 minutes to 30 seconds, resulting in a 75% reduction in development time and a 50% increase in productivity. This can lead to cost savings of up to $10,000 per year, depending on the size and complexity of the project.
