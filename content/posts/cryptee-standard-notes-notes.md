## Real-World Use Case: Notes
Let's consider a 20-person marketing team needing a secure note-taking solution. With Cryptee, setup complexity is around 2-3 hours, and ongoing maintenance burden is minimal. The cost breakdown for 20 users would be $199.80 per month (billed annually). However, common gotchas include the steep learning curve and limited integrations. In contrast, Standard Notes offers a more intuitive interface and broader ecosystem, but its limited focus on privacy may be a concern. Setup complexity is around 1 hour, and ongoing maintenance burden is minimal. The cost breakdown for 20 users would be $159.80 per month (billed annually).

## Migration Considerations
