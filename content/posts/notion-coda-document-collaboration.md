## Real-World Use Case: Document Collaboration
Let's say you're a 100-person marketing team that needs to collaborate on documents, track progress, and manage workflows. With Notion, setup complexity is relatively low, taking around 2-3 hours to set up a basic document collaboration system. Ongoing maintenance burden is also minimal, with automated workflows and notifications. However, as your team grows, Notion's limitations in scalability and advanced database functionality may become apparent. With Coda, setup complexity is higher, taking around 5-7 days to set up a customized document collaboration system. Ongoing maintenance burden is also higher, requiring regular updates and customization. However, Coda's advanced database features and scalability make it a better choice for large teams. Cost breakdown for 100 users: Notion ($4-8/user/month) = $400-800/month, Coda ($10-20/user/month) = $1,000-2,000/month.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Notion and Coda, data export/import limitations are a significant concern. Notion's export feature is limited to CSV and JSON files, while Coda's export feature supports a wider range of formats, including Excel and Google Sheets. Training time needed is also a consideration, with Coda requiring more extensive training due to its steeper learning curve. Hidden costs, such as custom development and integration fees, may also apply when migrating to Coda.
