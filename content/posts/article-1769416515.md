# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manually updating calendars with task deadlines and due dates. This integration saves teams 5 hours/week by automating the process, reducing the likelihood of missed deadlines and increasing productivity. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Managing project timelines and deadlines across teams.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both Trello and Google Calendar

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as which board and calendar to sync

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., "New Card")
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., "Create Event")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Card to Event
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New Card in Trello | Create Event in Google Calendar | Automatic creation of events for new cards |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, set up a separate Zap/Scenario with Google Calendar as the trigger and Trello as the action, allowing updates to events in Google Calendar to reflect in Trello cards.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring due dates are properly set in Trello cards

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for quick intervention and minimizing downtime.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar does not support syncing of checklist items as separate events.
- Google Calendar has rate limits on the number of events that can be created or updated per day.
- The free tier of Trello has limitations on the number of integrations that can be set up.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of Trello?
A: Yes, the integration works with the free tier of Trello, but with limitations on the number of integrations.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for native integrations, but can be scheduled for every 15 minutes via Zapier/Make for more complex workflows.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced, but this may require a manual backfill process or setting up a custom integration via Zapier/Make.
