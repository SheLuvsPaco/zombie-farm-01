## Real-World Use Case: Error Tracking
Let's consider a scenario where a 20-person team needs to track errors for a high-traffic web application. With GlitchTip, setup complexity is relatively low, requiring only 2-3 hours to configure and deploy. Ongoing maintenance burden is also minimal, with automated error grouping and filtering reducing the need for manual intervention. However, cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is limited, with GlitchTip's free plan supporting only 100,000 events per month. In contrast, Sentry requires 5-7 hours to set up and configure, with a more complex feature set and customization options. Ongoing maintenance burden is higher, with more manual intervention required to manage workflows and integrations. However, Sentry's cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is more comprehensive, with a paid plan supporting up to 1 million events per month.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between GlitchTip and Sentry, data export/import limitations are a significant consideration. GlitchTip's open-source nature makes it easier to export and import data, while Sentry's proprietary platform requires more effort to migrate data. Training time needed is also a factor, with Sentry's more complex feature set requiring 2-3 days of training for new users. Hidden costs, such as support and customization fees, can add up quickly when migrating to Sentry.
