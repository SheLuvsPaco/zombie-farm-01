# 5 Best Paddle Tools for Alternatives in 2026

## Why Alternatives Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they lack the specialized features required for SaaS billing and subscription management, such as automated invoicing, tax compliance, and revenue recognition.
- Alternatives specifically need SaaS Billing to manage complex subscription models, handle recurring payments, and scale their businesses efficiently.
- We tested these tools for subscription management, evaluating their ability to handle metered billing, usage-based pricing, and subscription upgrades/downgrades.
