# OSO vs OPA: Which is Better for Authorization?

## Quick Verdict
For teams with complex authorization requirements and a budget over $10,000 per year, OSO is the better choice due to its relationship-based approach and robust feature set. However, for smaller teams or those with simpler authorization needs, OPA's more affordable pricing and easier learning curve make it a more suitable option. Ultimately, the choice between OSO and OPA depends on the specific use case and requirements of the team.

## When to Choose OSO
- If you're a 100-person enterprise company with complex authorization requirements and a large budget, OSO's custom quote-based pricing and robust feature set make it a better choice.
- If you need relationship-based authorization, such as granting access to resources based on user relationships or group memberships, OSO is the better option.
- If you're a 50-person SaaS company with a large number of integrations and a high volume of user actions, OSO's scalability and pre-built integrations make it a better fit.
- If you require 24/7 priority support and a high level of customization, OSO's support and flexibility make it a better choice.

## When to Choose OPA
- If you're a 10-person startup with simple authorization requirements and a limited budget, OPA's affordable pricing and easy learning curve make it a more suitable option.
- If you need a quick and easy solution for attribute-based access control, OPA's gentle learning curve and standard support make it a better choice.
- If you're a 20-person team with a small number of integrations and a low volume of user actions, OPA's simplicity and affordability make it a better fit.
- If you require a solution with a low upfront cost and a simple, intuitive interface, OPA is the better option.

## Real-World Use Case: Authorization
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to implement authorization for 100 users and 500 actions. With OSO, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users and 500 actions would be around $5,000 per year. With OPA, the setup complexity would be around 1-2 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1 hour per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users and 500 actions would be around $2,000 per year. However, OPA may not be able to handle the complexity of the company's authorization requirements, leading to potential security risks and support issues.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from OSO to OPA, the data export/import limitations would be a significant concern, as OSO's custom quote-based pricing and robust feature set may make it difficult to export data in a compatible format. The training time needed would be around 1-2 days, and the hidden costs would include potential support issues and security risks due to the loss of relationship-based authorization. If switching from OPA to OSO, the data export/import limitations would be less of a concern, but the training time needed would be around 2-3 weeks, and the hidden costs would include potential customization and support issues.
