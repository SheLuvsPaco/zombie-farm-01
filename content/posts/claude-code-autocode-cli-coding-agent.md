## When to Choose AutoCode
* If you're a small team (less than 10 people) or a solo developer with a limited budget (under $1,000 per year), AutoCode's affordable pricing and gentle learning curve make it a more accessible option.
* For teams with simple use cases, such as basic code completion and review, AutoCode's basic reasoning capabilities may be sufficient.
* If your team has limited time for setup and training, AutoCode's quicker setup process (less than 1 day) and standard support can get you up and running faster.

## Real-World Use Case: CLI Coding Agent
Let's consider a scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to automate their CLI coding workflows using a coding agent. With Claude Code, the setup process takes around 2-3 days, and the ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low (less than 1 hour per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $5,000 per year. In contrast, AutoCode's setup process takes less than 1 day, but the ongoing maintenance burden is higher (around 2-3 hours per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $2,500 per year. However, AutoCode's basic reasoning capabilities may not be sufficient for complex workflows, and the company may need to invest in additional custom development.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Claude Code and AutoCode, teams should consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Claude Code allows for bulk export of coding agent data, while AutoCode has limited export options.
* Training time needed: Claude Code requires around 2-3 weeks of training for advanced reasoning capabilities, while AutoCode's basic capabilities can be learned in less than 1 day.
* Hidden costs: Claude Code's custom quote-based pricing may include additional costs for priority support, while AutoCode's standard support may incur additional costs for custom development.
