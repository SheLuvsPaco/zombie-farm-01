With Riverside, setup complexity is moderate, requiring 2-3 hours to configure the recording settings and test the equipment. Ongoing maintenance burden is low, with automatic transcription and editing features streamlining the post-production process. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $1,500/month. Common gotchas include ensuring stable internet connections and investing in high-quality microphones.
