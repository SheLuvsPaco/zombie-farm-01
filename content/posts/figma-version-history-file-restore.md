# Does Figma Have Version History? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Figma does have a version history feature, which allows users to track changes made to their designs over time, with a maximum of 30 days of history for free plans and unlimited history for paid plans. This feature enables designers to easily revert to previous versions of their work, collaborate with team members, and maintain a record of design iterations.

## How to Use Version History in Figma
1. Navigate to the "File" menu in the top-left corner of the Figma interface and select "Version History" from the dropdown list.
2. Click on a specific version to view the changes made, and use the "Restore" button to revert to that version.
3. Result: The selected version will be restored, and all subsequent changes will be discarded, allowing designers to start fresh from a previous point in their design process.

## Workarounds (Not Necessary)
Since Figma does support version history natively, there is no need for workarounds. However, for users who require more advanced version control features, such as branching and merging, Figma integrates with third-party tools like GitHub and GitLab.

## Better Alternatives for Version History
If Version History is a critical feature for your workflow, Figma's native implementation is robust. However, for comparison:
- **Alternative 1:** Adobe XD (Native support with a similar 30-day limit for free plans)
- **Alternative 2:** Sketch (Better implementation with unlimited history for all plans)

## FAQ
Q: Is Version History coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Figma's public roadmap, they are continually improving their version history feature, with recent updates including the ability to view and restore previous versions of files.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, version history is available on all Figma plans, including the free plan, with a maximum of 30 days of history. Paid plans, including the Professional and Enterprise plans, offer unlimited version history.
