# FlutterFlow Pricing 2026: The True Cost Explained

As a B2B procurement consultant, I have analyzed the pricing structure of FlutterFlow, a popular low-code development platform. In this article, I will break down the official tiers, highlight the hidden costs, and provide a comparison with competitors to help you make an informed decision.

## The Official Tiers (Simplified)
| Plan | Price | Key Limit | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | $0 | 5 projects, 100 screens | Testing, small projects |
| Starter | $29/month | 20 projects, 500 screens | Solopreneurs, small teams |
| Pro | $99/month | 50 projects, 2,000 screens | Scaling teams, enterprises |

## The "Hidden" Costs They Don't Mention
- **Seat Costs:** FlutterFlow charges per user, with each additional user costing $10/month on the Starter plan and $20/month on the Pro plan.
- **Add-ons:** API access and SSO (Single Sign-On) are included in the Pro plan, but cost an additional $20/month and $10/month, respectively, on the Starter plan.
- **Overage Fees:** If you exceed the project or screen limit on your plan, you will be charged $5/project and $0.10/screen, respectively. However, the true cost of owning your source code is often overlooked. With FlutterFlow, you can export your code for a fee, which ranges from $99 to $499, depending on the complexity of the project. This cost can add up quickly, especially for large or complex projects.

## Comparison: Is it Worth It?
- **vs Competitor A (Adalo):** Adalo offers a similar low-code development platform with a pricing structure that starts at $50/month for the Pro plan. While Adalo is more expensive than FlutterFlow, it offers more advanced features and a more comprehensive set of integrations.
- **vs Competitor B (Bubble):** Bubble offers a low-code development platform with a pricing structure that starts at $25/month for the Personal plan. Bubble is more affordable than FlutterFlow, but its features and scalability are limited compared to FlutterFlow's Pro plan.

## Strategic Recommendation
- **Buy the Pro plan if:** You need advanced features such as API access, SSO, and priority support. The Pro plan is also suitable for scaling teams and enterprises that require more projects and screens.
- **Stay on Free if:** You have less than 5 projects and 100 screens, and you don't need advanced features. The Free plan is suitable for testing, small projects, and solo developers.
- **Negotiation Tip:** If you're an enterprise customer, you can negotiate a custom plan with FlutterFlow that includes additional features, priority support, and a dedicated account manager. Be sure to ask about discounts for annual payments and bulk user licenses.

## FAQ
Q: Is there a startup discount?
A: Yes, FlutterFlow offers a 20% discount for startups that are less than 2 years old and have fewer than 10 employees.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
