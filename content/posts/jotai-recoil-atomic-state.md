## Real-World Use Case: Atomic State
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to manage atomic state for a simple e-commerce application. With Jotai, setting up atomic state management takes around 2-3 hours, and ongoing maintenance is relatively low. However, as the application scales, Jotai's limited optimization features may lead to performance issues. In contrast, Recoil's setup time may take around 1-2 days, but its advanced atomic state management and optimization features ensure better performance and scalability. For 100 users and actions, the cost breakdown for Jotai is essentially zero, while Recoil's cost is also zero, but its advanced features may require additional development time and resources.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Jotai and Recoil, data export/import limitations are minimal, as both libraries use standard React hooks. However, training time may be needed for developers to adapt to the new library, especially if switching from Jotai to Recoil. Hidden costs may include additional development time and resources required to optimize and fine-tune the new library.
