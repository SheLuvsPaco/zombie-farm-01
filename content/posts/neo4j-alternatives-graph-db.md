## FAQ
Q: Do I really need a dedicated Neo4j tool?
A: Yes, a dedicated Neo4j tool can provide a significant return on investment (ROI) by reducing development time, improving data consistency, and increasing query performance. For example, a company that migrates from a relational database to a Graph DB like Amazon Neptune can expect to reduce their query time by up to 90%, resulting in significant cost savings and improved user experience. In a real-world scenario, a company like LinkedIn uses a Graph DB to store and query its massive network of users, resulting in faster and more accurate people search results.
