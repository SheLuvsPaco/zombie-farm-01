## When to Choose Zustand
- When you're a small team (less than 10 people) with simple state management needs, Zustand's ease of use and minimal boilerplate make it an attractive choice.
- If you're a startup with a limited budget, Zustand's free and open-source nature can help you save on costs.
- If you're building a small to medium-sized application with straightforward state management requirements, Zustand's gentle learning curve and basic features can get you up and running quickly.
- For example, if you're a 10-person startup building a simple to-do list app, Zustand's simplicity and ease of use make it a great choice.

## When to Choose Redux Toolkit
- When you're a large team (more than 50 people) with complex state management needs, Redux Toolkit's robust features, scalability, and official support make it a better investment.
- If you're building a large, complex application with multiple integrations and requirements, Redux Toolkit's extensive library support and advanced features can help you manage state more effectively.
- If you're a enterprise company with a dedicated development team, Redux Toolkit's moderate learning curve and extensive features can provide long-term benefits and scalability.
- For instance, if you're a 100-person SaaS company building a complex CRM system, Redux Toolkit's advanced features and scalability make it a better choice.

## Real-World Use Case: State Management
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to manage user authentication state across multiple components in an application. With Zustand, setting up state management would take around 2-3 hours, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be $0, since Zustand is free and open-source. However, common gotchas include limited scalability and lack of official support.

With Redux Toolkit, setting up state management would take around 5-7 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 2-5 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be $0, since Redux Toolkit is also free and open-source. However, common gotchas include a steeper learning curve and moderate boilerplate reduction.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Zustand and Redux Toolkit, data export/import limitations include the need to rewrite existing state management code. Training time needed would be around 1-3 days for Zustand and 1-2 weeks for Redux Toolkit. Hidden costs include the potential need for additional development resources and infrastructure to support the more complex state management requirements of Redux Toolkit.

## FAQ
Q: Which tool has better performance for large-scale applications?
A: Redux Toolkit has better performance for large-scale applications, with a 30-50% reduction in rendering time compared to Zustand.
