# Does Loom Have Password Protection? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Loom offers password protection, but it is only available on the Business plan, limiting access for users on lower-tier plans. This means that if you're handling confidential videos and are not subscribed to the Business plan, you won't have native access to this feature, necessitating either an upgrade or exploring workarounds.

## How to Use Password Protection in Loom (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the video settings of the specific video you want to protect.
2. Click on the "Privacy" or "Security" tab, depending on the current Loom interface.
3. Result: You will see an option to require a password for viewers to access the video, which you can then set and share securely with intended recipients.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Loom's password protection is limited to the Business plan, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like Zapier or Integromat to automate password protection through external workflows, though this might add complexity.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a browser extension or plugin that offers video encryption or password protection, keeping in mind the potential security risks of using third-party solutions.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually share videos via private links and manage access through external means like email lists or shared document permissions, which can be cumbersome and less secure.

## Better Alternatives for Password Protection
If Password Protection is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Confidential Videos), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Wistia (Native support with robust access controls)
- **Alternative 2:** Vidyard (Better implementation with advanced security features like SSO and custom permissions)

## FAQ
Q: Is Password Protection coming in the roadmap?
A: As of the last public update, Loom has not announced plans to expand password protection to lower-tier plans, but users can submit feature requests through their support channel.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, password protection is available on the Business plan, which is below the Enterprise tier, making it more accessible to smaller businesses and teams, though still not an option for those on the lower plans.
