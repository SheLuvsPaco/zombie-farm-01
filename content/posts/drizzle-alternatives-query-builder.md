# 5 Best Drizzle Tools for Alternatives in 2026

## Why Alternatives Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they often lack the specific features and customization options required for efficient Drizzle management, such as robust query building capabilities.
- Alternatives specifically need Query Builder tools to streamline their database interactions, improve development efficiency, and reduce the complexity associated with manual query writing.
- We tested these tools for their Lightweight Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities, focusing on how well they balance ease of use, performance, and customization options.
