## When to Choose Railway
* If you're a 10-person startup with a limited budget and simple app hosting needs, Railway's cost-effective pricing and easy container deployment make it a great choice.
* If you prioritize ease of use and don't require advanced scalability features, Railway's intuitive interface and simple setup process make it a good option.
* If you're already using Docker and want to streamline your container deployment process, Railway's seamless integration with Docker makes it a great choice.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to host a simple web application with minimal traffic, Railway's basic plan ($25/month) can handle up to 10,000 requests per day.

## When to Choose Fly.io
* If you're a 100-person enterprise with complex app hosting requirements and high traffic volumes, Fly.io's advanced scalability features and wider range of integrations make it a better choice.
* If you need more control over your app hosting environment and are willing to invest time in manual configuration, Fly.io's customizable setup process makes it a good option.
* If you're already using Kubernetes and want to leverage its advanced features, Fly.io's native support for Kubernetes makes it a great choice.
* For example, if you're a 200-person e-commerce company needing to host a high-traffic web application with multiple microservices, Fly.io's custom plan (starting at $500/month) can handle up to 100,000 requests per day.

## Real-World Use Case: App Hosting
Let's say you're a 20-person startup needing to host a web application with 10,000 daily requests. With Railway, setup complexity is relatively low (2-3 hours), and ongoing maintenance burden is minimal (1-2 hours/week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $50/month (basic plan). Common gotchas include limited scalability and lack of advanced features. With Fly.io, setup complexity is higher (5-7 days), and ongoing maintenance burden is moderate (2-3 hours/week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $100/month (custom plan). Common gotchas include steep learning curve and higher costs.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Railway and Fly.io, data export/import limitations include potential downtime (up to 1 hour) and data loss (up to 10%). Training time needed for Fly.io is approximately 5-7 days, while hidden costs include potential additional fees for custom support (up to $500/month).
