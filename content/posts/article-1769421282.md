# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with manually updating leads and contacts across both platforms. This integration automates the process, ensuring that data is consistent and up-to-date. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Sales teams can focus on converting leads into customers, rather than manually updating contact information.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as mapping fields and setting up workflows

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, such as email address and phone number

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information is synced across both platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce contacts can also trigger updates in HubSpot, ensuring a bidirectional data flow. For example, when a contact's email address is updated in Salesforce, the change is reflected in HubSpot.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the email address field is mapped correctly

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This allows you to quickly identify and resolve issues, minimizing downtime and ensuring data consistency.

## Limitations to Know
- [Specific data types that don't sync]: Custom objects and certain types of files may not be supported
- [Rate limits on either side]: HubSpot has a limit of 100,000 API calls per day, while Salesforce has a limit of 1,000 API calls per 20-minute window
- [Feature gaps between tiers]: The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration, while the Enterprise tier of Salesforce has more advanced features for data syncing

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need to upgrade to the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but you can also schedule syncs to occur at specific intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can backfill historical data from HubSpot into Salesforce, but this may require additional setup and configuration.
