## Real-World Use Case: PaaS
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person team needs to deploy and scale a web application with 100 users and 1000 actions per day. With Qovery, the setup complexity is approximately 2 hours, and the ongoing maintenance burden is minimal due to automated deployment and scaling. The cost breakdown for 100 users and 1000 actions per day is approximately $150 per month. With Heroku, the setup complexity is approximately 5 days, and the ongoing maintenance burden is higher due to manual configuration and scaling. The cost breakdown for 100 users and 1000 actions per day is approximately $250 per month. Common gotchas with Heroku include manual scaling and configuration, which can lead to downtime and increased costs if not managed properly.

If switching between Qovery and Heroku, consider the following:
- Data export/import limitations: Qovery supports automated data migration, while Heroku requires manual data export and import.
