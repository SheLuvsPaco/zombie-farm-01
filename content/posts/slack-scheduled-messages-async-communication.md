# Does Slack Have Scheduled Messages? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Yes, Slack has native support for scheduled messages, allowing users to draft and schedule messages to be sent at a later time, which can be particularly useful for async communication and coordinating with team members across different time zones. This feature is available to all users, regardless of their plan, and can be accessed directly within the Slack interface.

## How to Use Scheduled Messages in Slack
1. Navigate to the message composition field in any Slack channel or direct message conversation.
2. Click on the arrow next to the "Send" button to reveal additional options, then select "Schedule message" from the dropdown menu.
3. Choose the date and time you want the message to be sent, and Slack will automatically send it at the designated time, allowing for more flexible and planned communication.

## Workarounds (If No)
Not applicable, as Slack natively supports scheduled messages.

## Better Alternatives for Scheduled Messages
If for some reason Slack's implementation of scheduled messages does not meet your specific needs for async communication, you might consider:
- **Microsoft Teams:** Offers native support for scheduled messages, with a similar implementation to Slack.
- **Google Workspace (formerly G Suite):** While primarily an email and document suite, its integration with Google Chat allows for scheduled messages, providing an alternative for teams already invested in the Google ecosystem.
