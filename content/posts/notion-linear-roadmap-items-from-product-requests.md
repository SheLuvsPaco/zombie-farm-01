* A Zapier or Integromat account for workflow automation

## The Workflow
The integration workflow involves the following 5 steps:
1. When a new product request is captured in Notion, trigger a Zapier or Integromat workflow.
2. The workflow creates a new issue in Linear, linked to the corresponding roadmap item.
3. Linear updates the roadmap item with the new issue information.
4. Notion syncs the updated roadmap item information back to the original request.
5. The workflow sends a notification to the product team, indicating that a new request has been synced to Linear.

## Best Practices
To ensure data security and efficient syncing:
* Limit API access to authorized personnel only.
* Set up a regular sync frequency (e.g., every 15 minutes) to ensure data consistency.
> [!TIP]
> **Pro-Tip:** Use a two-way sync to ensure that updates made in either Notion or Linear are reflected in both systems.
