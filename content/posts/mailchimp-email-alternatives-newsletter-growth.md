# **Maximizing Newsletter Growth: Exploring Mailchimp and Beyond for Higher Deliverability Rates**

As a newsletter creator, you understand the importance of delivering your content to subscribers' inboxes. However, with increasing competition and stringent email service provider (ESP) filters, achieving high deliverability rates can be a challenge. Mailchimp, a popular ESP, offers a range of features to support newsletter growth, but it may not be the best fit for every creator. In this guide, we'll explore Mailchimp and alternative ESPs to help you optimize your newsletter delivery and growth.

## **Understanding Deliverability Rates and Their Impact**

Deliverability rates refer to the percentage of emails that successfully land in subscribers' inboxes. A high deliverability rate is crucial for newsletter growth, as it directly affects engagement, conversion, and ultimately, revenue. According to a study by Return Path, emails with high deliverability rates (95% or higher) have an average open rate of 24.4%, compared to 12.1% for emails with lower deliverability rates (less than 80%).

## **Mailchimp: Features and Limitations**

Mailchimp is a well-established ESP with a user-friendly interface and a range of features, including automation, segmentation, and analytics. However, its deliverability rates can be affected by factors such as list quality, content, and sender reputation. Mailchimp's free plan has a limit of 2,000 subscribers and 12,000 emails per month, which can be restrictive for growing newsletters.

| Feature | Mailchimp | Alternative ESPs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deliverability Rate | 85-90% | 90-95% (e.g., ConvertKit, Klaviyo) |
| Automation | Yes | Yes (e.g., ActiveCampaign, Drip) |
| Segmentation | Yes | Yes (e.g., Campaign Monitor, Sendinblue) |
| Pricing | Free (up to 2,000 subs), $10-$300/month | $9-$149/month (e.g., ConvertKit), $9-$1,000/month (e.g., Klaviyo) |

## **Alternative ESPs for Higher Deliverability Rates**

Several alternative ESPs offer higher deliverability rates and more advanced features than Mailchimp. For example:

* ConvertKit: With a deliverability rate of 92%, ConvertKit is a popular choice among creators. Its automation features and customizable templates make it an attractive option for those looking to optimize their newsletter growth.
* Klaviyo: Klaviyo's deliverability rate of 95% makes it an ideal choice for e-commerce businesses and creators with large lists. Its advanced segmentation and automation features allow for highly targeted campaigns.

## **Step-by-Step Process for Switching to an Alternative ESP**

If you're considering switching to an alternative ESP, follow these steps:

1. **Export your list**: Export your subscriber list from Mailchimp in a CSV file.
2. **Choose an alternative ESP**: Select an alternative ESP that meets your needs and budget.
3. **Import your list**: Import your subscriber list into the new ESP.
4. **Set up automation and segmentation**: Configure automation and segmentation features to optimize your newsletter growth.
5. **Test and monitor deliverability**: Test your emails and monitor deliverability rates to ensure a smooth transition.

## **Practical Tips for Optimizing Deliverability Rates**

To maximize your deliverability rates, follow these tips:

* **Warm up your IP address**: Gradually increase your email sending volume to avoid being flagged as spam.
* **Use a clear and relevant subject line**: Avoid using spammy keywords and ensure your subject line accurately reflects the content of your email.
* **Segment your list**: Divide your list into targeted groups to increase engagement and reduce spam complaints.
