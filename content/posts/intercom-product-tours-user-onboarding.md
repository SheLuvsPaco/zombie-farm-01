# Does Intercom Have Product Tours? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Intercom does offer Product Tours, but it requires add-on pricing, which means that users need to pay an extra fee to access this feature. This add-on is part of Intercom's broader suite of user engagement tools, designed to enhance the onboarding experience, but the additional cost may be a consideration for some users.

## How to Use Product Tours in Intercom (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the "Customize" section in your Intercom dashboard, where you can find various tools for personalizing your user experience.
2. Click on "Product Tours" and follow the prompts to set up your first tour, which involves defining the steps and content you want to highlight for your users.
3. Result: Your Product Tour will be live, guiding new users through key features of your application, with the goal of reducing friction and improving overall user engagement.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Intercom's native Product Tours feature requires an add-on, if you're looking for alternatives without the extra cost, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like Nickelled or Walkme, which specialize in product tours and can integrate with Intercom to some extent.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Userflow, which can provide similar functionality to Product Tours within your Intercom setup.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a series of automated messages or emails that mimic a product tour by highlighting different features over time, though this method lacks the interactive and visual aspects of true product tours.

## Better Alternatives for Product Tours
If Product Tours is a dealbreaker for your workflow (User Onboarding), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Userpilot (Native support) offers comprehensive product tour capabilities as part of its onboarding and user engagement suite.
- **Alternative 2:** Appcues (Better implementation) provides advanced product tour features, including personalized and conditional logic-based tours, making it a strong contender for those prioritizing this feature.

## FAQ
Q: Is Product Tours coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Intercom's public roadmap, there are discussions about enhancing the onboarding experience, but there's no specific mention of making Product Tours a standard feature without add-on pricing.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The Product Tours feature in Intercom is available as an add-on across various pricing tiers, not exclusively to the Enterprise plan, meaning that any user can access this feature by paying the additional fee, regardless of their current plan.
