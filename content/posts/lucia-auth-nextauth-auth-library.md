## When to Choose Lucia Auth
* If you're a 10-person startup with a tight budget and a focus on TypeScript development, Lucia Auth's free plan and affordable pricing model make it an attractive choice.
* If you're a 20-person team with a simple authentication setup, Lucia Auth's ease of use and community-driven support may be sufficient for your needs.

## Real-World Use Case: Auth Library
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to implement authentication for a web application with 100 users and 1000 actions per day. With Lucia Auth, setup complexity is around 2-3 hours, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low due to its simple architecture. The cost breakdown for 100 users is $0 (free plan), and common gotchas include configuring passwordless authentication and handling session management. In contrast, NextAuth requires around 4-5 hours of setup time and has a higher ongoing maintenance burden due to its more complex feature set. The cost breakdown for 100 users is $0 (free plan), but the cost increases to $199/month for 100-1000 users.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Lucia Auth and NextAuth, data export/import limitations include the need to migrate user data and authentication settings. Training time needed is around 1-2 days, depending on the complexity of the authentication setup. Hidden costs include potential downtime during the migration process and the need to update dependencies and integrations.
