# Does Notion Have Calendar? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Notion does have a calendar feature, but it's primarily based on database dates, which can be used to create calendar views. This means that while you can visualize and interact with dates in a calendar format, the functionality is more geared towards organizing and tracking data associated with those dates rather than traditional calendar scheduling.

## How to Use Calendar in Notion (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the page where you want to add a calendar view, and ensure you have a database with a date property.
2. Click on the "Add a View" button in your database and select "Calendar" from the available view types.
3. Result: Your database entries will be displayed in a calendar format, allowing you to see the distribution of your data over time and interact with the entries directly from the calendar view.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Notion's native calendar feature is centered around database dates and might not fully replace a traditional calendar for scheduling, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Google Calendar or Apple Calendar through Zapier or Integromat to synchronize your events and appointments.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Calendar by Notion or Simple Calendar to enhance the calendar view and functionality within Notion.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a table or board with date columns and use filters or sorting to mimic a scheduling system, although this will require more maintenance and may not offer the same convenience as a dedicated calendar tool.

## Better Alternatives for Calendar
If Calendar is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Scheduling), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) - Offers a robust calendar application with native support for scheduling and integration with other Google apps.
- **Alternative 2:** Microsoft 365 - Provides a comprehensive calendar feature as part of Outlook, with advanced scheduling capabilities and seamless integration with other Microsoft tools.

## FAQ
Q: Is Calendar coming in the roadmap?
A: As of the last public roadmap update, Notion has been focusing on enhancing its database and page features, but there's no clear indication of a traditional calendar feature being added. However, the community has been vocal about the need for more robust scheduling capabilities.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The current calendar view feature based on database dates is available across all Notion plans, including the free version. There are no indications that enhanced calendar features, if added, would be exclusively gated to the Enterprise plan, but certain advanced integrations or features might require a paid subscription.
