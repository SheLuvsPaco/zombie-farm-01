# Does Canva Have Background Remover? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Canva features a one-click AI-powered background removal tool, allowing users to easily remove backgrounds from images in a matter of seconds. This feature is particularly useful for product photography, where a clean and distraction-free background is crucial for showcasing products effectively.

## How to Use Background Remover in Canva
1. Navigate to the Canva editor and upload your image by clicking on the "Uploads" tab and selecting the file you want to work with.
2. Click on the "Edit image" button and then select the "Background remover" option from the toolbar, which will automatically remove the background using AI.
3. Result: The background of your image will be removed, and you can then adjust the result if needed, or proceed to use the image with a transparent background in your design.

## Workarounds (Not Necessary)
Since Canva does support background removal natively, there's no need for workarounds. However, for completeness, if this feature were not available, you could:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a third-party tool like Remove.bg or Adobe Photoshop to remove backgrounds.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Background Remover by InPixio, which offers advanced background removal capabilities.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually remove the background using the magic wand or lasso tool, which can be time-consuming and requires some skill.

## Better Alternatives for Background Remover
If Background Remover is a critical feature for your workflow (Product Photography), and you're looking for alternatives or additional options, consider:
- **Alternative 1:** Adobe Photoshop (Native support with advanced features)
- **Alternative 2:** Sketch (Better implementation with vector capabilities)
