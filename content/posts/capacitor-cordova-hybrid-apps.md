# Capacitor vs Cordova: Which is Better for Hybrid Apps?

## Quick Verdict
For teams of 10-50 developers with a moderate budget, Capacitor is the better choice due to its modern architecture and seamless integration with web technologies. However, for smaller teams or those with existing Cordova investments, Cordova remains a viable option. Ultimately, the choice between Capacitor and Cordova depends on your specific use case and priorities.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | Capacitor | Cordova | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | Free, open-source | Free, open-source | Tie |
| Learning Curve | Steeper due to modern web tech | Gentler, more established community | Cordova |
| Integrations | Native integration with Ionic, Angular, React, Vue | Wide range of third-party plugins | Capacitor |
| Scalability | Better support for large, complex apps | Can become cumbersome at scale | Capacitor |
| Support | Official support from Ionic, community-driven | Large, established community | Cordova |
| ModernWebView | Native support, out-of-the-box | Requires additional configuration | Capacitor |
| Plugin Ecosystem | Growing, but smaller than Cordova's | Large, established ecosystem | Cordova |

## When to Choose Capacitor
* If you're a 20-person startup building a complex, data-driven hybrid app with a modern web tech stack, Capacitor's native integration with Ionic and modern web technologies makes it a better choice.
* For teams with existing investments in Angular, React, or Vue, Capacitor's seamless integration with these frameworks can reduce development time and costs.
* If you're building a hybrid app that requires low-level native access, Capacitor's modern architecture and native integration with web technologies provide a more efficient and scalable solution.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to build a hybrid app with a complex, data-driven UI, Capacitor's support for large, complex apps makes it a better fit.

## When to Choose Cordova
* If you're a small team of 2-5 developers with limited budget and resources, Cordova's gentler learning curve and larger community make it a more accessible choice.
* For teams with existing Cordova investments, such as plugins and custom code, it may be more cost-effective to stick with Cordova rather than migrating to Capacitor.
* If you're building a simple hybrid app with limited native functionality, Cordova's wide range of third-party plugins and large community make it a viable option.
* For example, if you're a 5-person agency building a simple hybrid app for a client, Cordova's ease of use and large community make it a better choice.

## Real-World Use Case: Hybrid Apps
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to build a hybrid app for a medium-sized business with 100 users. Both Capacitor and Cordova can handle this scenario, but with different setup complexities and ongoing maintenance burdens.
* Setup complexity: Capacitor requires 2-3 days of setup time, while Cordova requires 4-5 days due to the need for additional configuration.
* Ongoing maintenance burden: Capacitor's modern architecture and native integration with web technologies reduce the maintenance burden, with an estimated 10 hours of maintenance per month. Cordova, on the other hand, requires an estimated 20 hours of maintenance per month due to the need for manual plugin updates and configuration.
* Cost breakdown: For 100 users, Capacitor's cost breakdown is estimated to be $500 per month ( hosting, maintenance, and updates), while Cordova's cost breakdown is estimated to be $800 per month (hosting, maintenance, updates, and plugin licenses).
* Common gotchas: One common gotcha with Capacitor is the need for modern web technology expertise, while Cordova's large plugin ecosystem can lead to versioning conflicts and compatibility issues.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Capacitor and Cordova, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Both Capacitor and Cordova support data export and import, but Capacitor's modern architecture makes it easier to migrate data between platforms.
* Training time needed: Capacitor requires an estimated 2-3 weeks of training time for developers familiar with web technologies, while Cordova requires an estimated 4-6 weeks of training time due to its unique architecture and plugin ecosystem.
* Hidden costs: Capacitor's native integration with web technologies can reduce hidden costs associated with plugin licenses and custom code, while Cordova's large plugin ecosystem can lead to unexpected costs due to versioning conflicts and compatibility issues.

## FAQ
Q: What is the main difference between Capacitor and Cordova?
A: The main difference between Capacitor and Cordova is Capacitor's modern architecture and native integration with web technologies, which provides a more efficient and scalable solution for hybrid app development.

Q: Can I use both Capacitor and Cordova together?
