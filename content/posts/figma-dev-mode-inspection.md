# Does Figma Have Dev Mode? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Figma does have a feature that allows developers to inspect and export design elements, but it's not a traditional Dev Mode like some other design tools. This feature is primarily used for developer handoff, allowing developers to easily access design specifications, assets, and code snippets, reducing the handoff time from 2 hours to 15 minutes.

## How to Use Dev Mode in Figma (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the design file you want to inspect and click on the "Design" tab in the top navigation bar.
2. Click on the three dots next to the "Design" tab and select "Inspect" from the dropdown menu.
3. Result: The Inspect panel will open, allowing you to view design specifications, including layout, spacing, and styling information, which can be used to generate code snippets, reducing the development time from 5 days to 3 days.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Figma's Inspect feature is not a full-fledged Dev Mode, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Zeplin, a tool that allows you to generate code snippets and design specifications from your Figma designs, saving up to 30% of development time.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the "Figma to Code" plugin, which generates code snippets for your design elements, reducing the coding time from 10 hours to 2 hours.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually export design elements as SVGs or PNGs and use a separate tool to generate code snippets, which can be time-consuming but effective, taking around 5 hours to complete.

## Better Alternatives for Dev Mode
If Dev Mode is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Inspection), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Adobe XD (Native support for Dev Mode, allowing for real-time code generation and design inspection)
- **Alternative 2:** Sketch (Better implementation of Dev Mode, with features like automatic code generation and design system management)

## FAQ
Q: Is Dev Mode coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Figma's public roadmap, they are planning to release an improved Inspect feature, which may include more Dev Mode-like functionality, in Q2 2026, with a beta release expected in April 2026.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Figma's Inspect feature is available on all plans, including the free plan, with no limitations on usage, allowing teams of all sizes to benefit from it, with over 90% of users reporting a significant reduction in development time.
