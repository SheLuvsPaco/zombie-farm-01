# Does Slack Have AI Recap? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Slack offers a daily digest automation feature that summarizes channel activity, but it doesn't have a native AI-powered recap feature. This daily digest automation can be customized to provide a summary of important messages and activity in a channel, reducing the need for manual scanning and saving users around 10-15 minutes per day.

## How to Use AI Recap in Slack (If Yes)
Since Slack doesn't have a native AI recap feature, but offers daily digest automation, here's how to use it:
1. Navigate to the channel settings by clicking on the three dots next to the channel name and selecting "Edit channel".
2. Click on the "Integrations" tab and then click on "Add an Integration".
3. Result: You can set up a daily digest automation using a third-party integration, such as a custom bot or a dedicated summary tool, which can provide a summary of channel activity, similar to an AI recap.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Slack doesn't support AI recap natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like SummarizeBot, which can provide automated summaries of channel conversations, reducing sync time from 15 minutes to around 2-3 minutes.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like AutoSummary, which can automatically generate summaries of long conversations, saving users around 5-10 minutes per conversation.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a summary of important messages and pin it to the channel, which can take around 5-10 minutes, but provides a temporary solution until a more automated solution is found.

## Better Alternatives for AI Recap
If AI Recap is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Channel Summary), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Microsoft Teams (Native support for AI-powered conversation summaries)
- **Alternative 2:** Google Workspace (Better implementation of AI-powered summary features, including automatic summarization of long conversations)

## FAQ
Q: Is AI Recap coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Slack's public roadmap, there are plans to improve conversation summarization features, but no specific timeline has been announced.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The daily digest automation feature is available on all Slack plans, including the free plan, but some advanced features and integrations may require an upgrade to a paid plan, such as the Standard or Plus plan.
