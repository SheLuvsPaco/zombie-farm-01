Let's say you're a 20-person e-commerce company with a simple online store, and you want to set up an email marketing campaign to promote your products. With Mailchimp, setup complexity is relatively low, taking around 2-3 hours to set up a basic campaign. Ongoing maintenance burden is also relatively low, requiring around 1-2 hours per week to manage and monitor the campaign. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $10-20 per month. However, one common gotcha is that Mailchimp's basic automation features may not be sufficient for more complex e-commerce needs.
