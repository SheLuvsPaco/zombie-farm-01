# Does Perplexity Have Collections? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Perplexity does not have traditional collections like some other library tools, but it does offer a feature called "Saved searches" that allows users to save and reuse specific search queries. This feature can be used to curate and organize relevant information, similar to how collections are used in other tools, but with a focus on search queries rather than manually curated lists.

## How to Use Collections in Perplexity (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the search bar in Perplexity and enter a query that you want to save for later use.
2. Click on the "Save search" button, which will prompt you to give the search a name and optionally add it to a list of saved searches.
3. Result: Your saved search will be added to the list of saved searches, allowing you to easily reuse it in the future and see the results of the query, which can be used to create a collection of relevant information.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Perplexity doesn't support traditional collections natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like Zotero or Mendeley, which offer robust collection management features and can be integrated with Perplexity.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a browser extension like LibX, which allows you to create and manage collections of resources from various sources, including Perplexity.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a note or document in Perplexity with links to relevant resources, and use the search function to find and organize these notes, effectively creating a makeshift collection.

## Better Alternatives for Collections
If Collections is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Library), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** EndNote (Native support for collections and organization of resources)
- **Alternative 2:** Calibre (Better implementation of collections, with features like tagging and filtering)

## FAQ
Q: Is Collections coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Perplexity's public roadmap, there are plans to enhance the saved searches feature, but there is no specific mention of traditional collections.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The saved searches feature is available on all plans, including the free plan, so you can start using it regardless of your pricing tier.
