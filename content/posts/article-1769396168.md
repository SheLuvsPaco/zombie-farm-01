# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manually updating calendars with task deadlines and due dates. This integration automates the process, reducing the time spent on manual updates and minimizing errors. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Managing project deadlines and team schedules

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both tools

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as which board and calendar to sync

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., "New Card")
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., "Create Event")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Card to Event
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New Card in Trello | Create Event in Google Calendar | Automated calendar updates with task deadlines |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Google Calendar events can also be synced back to Trello as new cards, allowing for bidirectional data flow and ensuring that both tools are up-to-date.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the card title is mapped to the event title

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for quick resolution and minimizing downtime.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar only syncs one-way, from Trello to Google Calendar
- Google Calendar has a rate limit of 1000 requests per day, which can be reached if syncing a large number of cards
- The free tier of Trello has limited integration capabilities, while the paid tier offers more advanced features

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of Trello?
A: Yes, but with limited integration capabilities. The paid tier offers more advanced features.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at specific intervals if needed.
