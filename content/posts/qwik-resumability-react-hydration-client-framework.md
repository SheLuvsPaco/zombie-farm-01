## When to Choose Qwik Resumability
- When you need a fast, zero-JS solution for a small to medium-sized project with limited budget, Qwik Resumability is a good choice.
- If your team is already familiar with Qwik's ecosystem, the learning curve will be shorter, and you can take advantage of its native zero-JS capabilities.
- For example, if you're a 20-person startup needing a quick prototype with zero-JS, Qwik Resumability can help you get started in under a week.
- Additionally, Qwik Resumability is a good fit for teams with limited resources, as it requires less maintenance and has a smaller footprint.

## When to Choose React Hydration
- When you're working on a large-scale project with an existing React codebase, React Hydration is a better choice due to its extensive community support and scalability.
- If your team is already invested in the React ecosystem, the learning curve for React Hydration will be shorter, and you can leverage the vast number of available libraries and integrations.
- For instance, if you're a 100-person enterprise company with a complex React application, React Hydration can help you improve performance and scalability.
- Additionally, React Hydration is a good fit for teams with complex, data-driven applications, as it provides more advanced features and tools for managing state and side effects.

## Real-World Use Case: Client Framework
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to build a client framework for a SaaS application with 100 users. Both Qwik Resumability and React Hydration can handle this scenario, but with different setup complexities and ongoing maintenance burdens.
- Setup complexity: Qwik Resumability requires 2-3 days of setup, while React Hydration requires 5-7 days due to the additional setup required for zero-JS and server-side rendering.
- Ongoing maintenance burden: Qwik Resumability requires less maintenance, with an estimated 1-2 hours per week, while React Hydration requires more maintenance, with an estimated 5-10 hours per week.
- Cost breakdown: For 100 users, Qwik Resumability costs approximately $0 (open-source), while React Hydration costs approximately $0 (open-source), but may require additional costs for libraries and integrations.
- Common gotchas: With Qwik Resumability, be aware of the limited library support, while with React Hydration, be aware of the additional setup required for zero-JS and server-side rendering.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Qwik Resumability and React Hydration:
- Data export/import limitations: Qwik Resumability has limited data export/import capabilities, while React Hydration has more extensive data export/import capabilities.
- Training time needed: Qwik Resumability requires 2-3 weeks of training, while React Hydration requires 1-2 weeks of training.
- Hidden costs: Qwik Resumability has limited library support, which may require additional development time and costs, while React Hydration has more extensive library support, but may require additional costs for libraries and integrations.
