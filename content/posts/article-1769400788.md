# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the synchronization of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize lead status updates in real-time, ensuring that both sales and marketing teams have the most up-to-date information.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing lead status updates between HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure data consistency and reduce manual data entry.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger (e.g., "New Contact Created")
3. Set Salesforce as the action (e.g., "Create New Contact")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot's "Email" field to Salesforce's "Email" field

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New lead created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead data is synchronized between HubSpot and Salesforce |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a sales representative updates a lead's status in Salesforce, the change can be synced back to HubSpot, ensuring that marketing teams have the latest information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by reconnecting the integration in HubSpot's settings
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid exceeding Salesforce's API limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping to ensure that all necessary fields are being synced between HubSpot and Salesforce

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing you to quickly investigate and resolve issues.

## Limitations to Know
- HubSpot's free tier does not support Salesforce integration
- Salesforce has a limit of 1,000 API calls per day for Enterprise tier accounts
- The native integration does not support syncing custom objects

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need at least the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some objects may be synced on a scheduled basis (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data from HubSpot to Salesforce, but this may require additional setup and configuration.
