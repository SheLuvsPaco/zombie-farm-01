# Resend vs SendGrid: Which is Better for Email API?

## Quick Verdict

However, for larger teams or those requiring more advanced features, SendGrid's scalability and extensive integrations make it a more suitable option. Ultimately, the choice between Resend and SendGrid depends on your team's specific needs and budget.

## When to Choose Resend
* If you're a small team (less than 10 users) with a limited budget (less than $100/month) and need a simple email API solution with modern DX and React templates, Resend is a good choice.
* If you're building a React-based application and want to integrate email functionality with minimal setup time (under 1 hour), Resend's pre-built templates can save you time and effort.
* If you're a 20-person startup needing to send fewer than 10,000 emails per month, Resend's pricing model and ease of use make it a cost-effective option.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to send transactional emails to your users, Resend's email API features and support for webhooks can help you get started quickly.

## When to Choose SendGrid
* If you're a large team (over 100 users) with a budget of over $500/month and need advanced email API features, such as dedicated IPs and advanced analytics, SendGrid is a better choice.
* If you're integrating email functionality with multiple platforms (e.g., Salesforce, WordPress), SendGrid's extensive integrations and support for over 50 services make it a more suitable option.
* If you're a 500-person enterprise needing to send over 1 million emails per month, SendGrid's scalability and support for large volumes of email traffic make it a more reliable choice.
* For instance, if you're a 200-person e-commerce company needing to send personalized emails to your customers, SendGrid's advanced analytics and support for A/B testing can help you optimize your email campaigns.

## Real-World Use Case: Email API
Let's consider a scenario where a 20-person startup needs to send transactional emails to its users. With Resend, setup time is under 1 hour, and ongoing maintenance burden is minimal (less than 1 hour/week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is $25/month. However, with SendGrid, setup time is around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is moderate (around 2-3 hours/week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is $14.95/month. Common gotchas with SendGrid include the need for dedicated IPs for large volumes of email traffic and the complexity of setting up advanced analytics.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Resend to SendGrid, data export/import limitations include the need to reconfigure email templates and webhooks. Training time needed is around 2-3 days, and hidden costs include the potential need for dedicated IPs and additional support services. Conversely, if switching from SendGrid to Resend, data export/import limitations include the need to reconfigure integrations and analytics. Training time needed is around 1-2 days, and hidden costs include the potential need for additional development resources to integrate Resend's modern DX and React templates.
