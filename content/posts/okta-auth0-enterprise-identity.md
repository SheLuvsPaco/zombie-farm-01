## Real-World Use Case: Enterprise Identity
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a large enterprise needs to manage access to multiple applications and services for its 10,000 employees. With Okta, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, with ongoing maintenance burden requiring 1-2 IT personnel. The cost breakdown for 10,000 users would be around $15,000-30,000 per month, depending on the specific features and integrations required. Common gotchas include ensuring proper configuration of multi-factor authentication and password management. In contrast, Auth0 would require around 1-2 days for setup, with ongoing maintenance burden requiring 0.5-1 IT personnel. The cost breakdown for 10,000 users would be around $10,000-20,000 per month, depending on the specific features and integrations required.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Okta and Auth0, data export/import limitations include the need to manually migrate user data and configurations. Training time needed would be around 1-2 weeks for IT personnel to learn the new system. Hidden costs include potential consulting fees for custom integrations or configuration.
