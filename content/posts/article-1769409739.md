# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the synchronization of contact, lead, and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 10 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information and lead status between HubSpot's marketing automation platform and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing contact information and lead status between HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure data consistency and automate sales and marketing workflows.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, including email, name, and company

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Contact Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information synchronized between HubSpot and Salesforce |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a deal is closed or a contact's status is updated. This bidirectional data flow ensures that both systems have the most up-to-date information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure that all necessary fields are included in the sync configuration

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This allows teams to quickly identify and resolve issues, minimizing downtime and ensuring data consistency.

## Limitations to Know
- HubSpot's free tier does not support Salesforce integration
- Salesforce has rate limits on API calls, which can impact sync frequency
- The native integration does not support syncing custom objects or certain data types, such as files or notes

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need to be on the Professional or Enterprise tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but you can also schedule syncs to occur at specific intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data, but this may require additional configuration and setup. It's recommended to test the sync with a small dataset before syncing larger amounts of historical data.
