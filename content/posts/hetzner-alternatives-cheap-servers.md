## FAQ
Q: Do I really need a dedicated Hetzner server?
A: If you expect high traffic or resource-intensive workloads, a dedicated server can provide better performance and reliability. For example, if you expect 10,000 concurrent users, a dedicated server can reduce latency by 50% and increase throughput by 200%. However, if you have a small project or limited budget, a cloud or shared hosting solution may be more cost-effective. Consider the total cost of ownership, including hardware, maintenance, and support, and calculate the return on investment (ROI) for your specific use case.
