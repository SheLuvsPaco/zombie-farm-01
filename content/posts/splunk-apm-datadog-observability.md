## Real-World Use Case: Observability
Let's consider a scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to set up observability for its e-commerce platform. With Splunk APM, the setup complexity would be around 5-7 days, requiring significant expertise in log analysis and configuration. Ongoing maintenance would require approximately 10 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $3,000 per month. Common gotchas include the need for careful log data management and potential performance issues if not properly configured.

In contrast, Datadog would require around 2-3 days for setup, with a more user-friendly interface and streamlined onboarding process. Ongoing maintenance would require approximately 5 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $1,500 per month. Common gotchas include the need for careful agent configuration and potential limitations in log analysis capabilities.

If switching between Splunk APM and Datadog, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Splunk APM's data export capabilities are more comprehensive, but may require additional configuration. Datadog's data import capabilities are more streamlined, but may have limitations in terms of data format and volume.
* Training time needed: Splunk APM requires significant expertise in log analysis and configuration, with a training time of around 2-3 weeks. Datadog's training time is around 1-2 weeks, with a more user-friendly interface and streamlined onboarding process.
* Hidden costs: Splunk APM's pricing model can lead to unexpected costs if log data volumes exceed expectations. Datadog's pricing model is more predictable, but may have hidden costs associated with additional features or support.
