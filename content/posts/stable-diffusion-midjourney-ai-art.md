## Real-World Use Case: AI Art
Let's say you're a 20-person design team needing to generate AI art for a client's social media campaign. With Stable Diffusion, setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost would be $0, since Stable Diffusion is free. However, with Midjourney, setup complexity would be around 1-2 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1 hour per week. The cost would be around $200-$500 per month, depending on the subscription plan. Common gotchas with Stable Diffusion include its steep learning curve and limited integrations, while Midjourney's limitations include its paid subscription and limited customization options.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, data export/import limitations include the need to retrain models and reconfigure workflows. Training time needed would be around 1-2 weeks, depending on the complexity of the models. Hidden costs include the need to purchase additional hardware or software to support the new tool.

## FAQ
Q: Which tool is better for generating realistic AI art?
