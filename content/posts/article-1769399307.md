# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with manual data entry and synchronization between these two critical tools. By automating the flow of contact, lead, and customer data, teams can reduce errors and improve the overall customer experience. 
- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Sales teams can focus on high-value activities like closing deals and building relationships, rather than wasting time on data entry and manual synchronization.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as mapping contact fields and setting up lead scoring

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new lead)
4. Map fields accordingly, such as email address and phone number

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead is created in Salesforce with synced contact information |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a lead is converted to an opportunity. This bidirectional data flow ensures that both systems have the most up-to-date information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that email addresses are properly formatted

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing you to quickly investigate and resolve issues.

## Limitations to Know
- Custom objects in Salesforce may not sync with HubSpot
- HubSpot's API has rate limits of 100 requests per 10 seconds
- The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need to upgrade to the Professional or Enterprise tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but you can also schedule syncs to occur at specific intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data from both HubSpot and Salesforce, but this may require additional setup and configuration.
