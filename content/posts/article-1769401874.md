# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information, lead status, and sales activity between HubSpot's marketing automation platform and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or Make
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot contact properties to Salesforce contact fields

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead is synced with contact information |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, you can also set up a workflow where updates made in Salesforce are synced back to HubSpot. For example, when a lead's status is updated in Salesforce, the corresponding contact in HubSpot is updated with the new status.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by reconnecting your Salesforce account in HubSpot's integration settings
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid hitting Salesforce's API rate limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping between HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure all necessary fields are synced

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing you to quickly investigate and resolve issues.

## Limitations to Know
- Custom objects in Salesforce may not be supported by the native HubSpot integration
- Rate limits on Salesforce's API can limit the frequency of syncs
- Feature gaps between HubSpot's Professional and Enterprise tiers may affect the depth of integration with Salesforce

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the integration requires at least a Professional tier account in HubSpot.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some syncs may be scheduled (e.g., every 15 minutes) due to API rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can backfill historical data from one platform to the other, but this may require manual configuration and could be subject to API rate limits.
