# Does Vercel Have Preview? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Vercel offers a feature called "Deploy Previews" which provides per-branch URLs, allowing developers to preview their application for each branch. This means that for every branch in your Git repository, Vercel generates a unique URL that can be used to preview the application in that specific branch, making it easier to test and review changes before merging them into the main branch.

## How to Use Preview in Vercel (If Yes)
1. Navigate to your Vercel project dashboard and select the project you want to preview.
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab and find the deployment corresponding to the branch you want to preview.
3. Result: You will see a "Preview" button next to the deployment, which will take you to the per-branch URL where you can preview your application.

## Workarounds (If No)
Not applicable, as Vercel supports Deploy Previews natively.

## Better Alternatives for Preview
If Vercel's Deploy Previews do not meet your specific needs, these tools have alternative preview features:
- **Alternative 1:** Netlify (Native support for branch previews)
- **Alternative 2:** Cloudflare Pages (Better implementation with more customization options)
