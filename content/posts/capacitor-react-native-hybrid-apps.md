# Capacitor vs React Native: Which is Better for Hybrid Apps?

## Quick Verdict
For small to medium-sized teams with limited budgets, Capacitor is a more cost-effective solution with a gentler learning curve, while large enterprises with complex requirements may prefer React Native's native performance and extensive community support. Ultimately, the choice between Capacitor and React Native depends on your team's specific needs, scalability requirements, and the type of hybrid app you're building. If you're looking for a more straightforward, web-based approach, Capacitor might be the better choice.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | Capacitor | React Native | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | Free, open-source | Free, open-source | Tie |
| Learning Curve | 1-3 months for web developers | 3-6 months for native developers | Capacitor |
| Integrations | Supports web-based APIs and plugins | Supports native modules and third-party libraries | React Native |
| Scalability | Handles up to 10,000 users with minimal issues | Handles over 100,000 users with optimal performance | React Native |
| Support | Official documentation, community forums | Official documentation, large community, Facebook support | React Native |
| Hybrid App Features | Uses WebView for rendering, limited native access | Uses native components, direct hardware access | React Native |
| Platform Support | Web, mobile, desktop | Mobile, TV, VR | Capacitor |

## When to Choose Capacitor
- If you're a 10-person startup with a limited budget and a simple hybrid app idea, Capacitor's free, open-source model and web-based approach can help you get started quickly.
- When you need to deploy your hybrid app on multiple platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop, Capacitor's platform-agnostic approach can simplify your development process.
- If your team consists of web developers with limited native experience, Capacitor's gentle learning curve can help them adapt to hybrid app development.
- For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing a simple, web-based hybrid app for customer engagement, Capacitor can help you reduce development time and costs.

## When to Choose React Native
- If you're a large enterprise with complex, data-driven hybrid apps and a team of experienced native developers, React Native's native performance and extensive community support can ensure optimal results.
- When you need direct access to native hardware components, such as cameras, GPS, or fingerprint scanners, React Native's native modules can provide the required functionality.
- If your hybrid app requires high scalability, security, and performance, React Native's native approach can help you achieve these goals.
- For instance, if you're a 500-person company developing a complex, data-intensive hybrid app for financial services, React Native's native capabilities and large community support can help you ensure reliability and security.

## Real-World Use Case: Hybrid Apps
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to build a hybrid app for a retail company with 100 users. With Capacitor, the setup complexity is relatively low, requiring around 2-3 days to set up the project, while React Native requires around 5-7 days due to its native setup process. Ongoing maintenance burden is also lower with Capacitor, with an estimated 10 hours per month, compared to React Native's 20 hours per month. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is as follows:
- Capacitor: $0 (free, open-source) + $500 (server costs) = $500
- React Native: $0 (free, open-source) + $2,000 (server costs) + $1,000 (native module development) = $3,000
Common gotchas include Capacitor's limited native access and React Native's steep learning curve for web developers.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Capacitor and React Native, consider the following:
- Data export/import limitations: Capacitor's web-based approach makes it easier to export and import data, while React Native's native approach requires more effort.
- Training time needed: React Native requires more training time for web developers, with an estimated 2-3 months, while Capacitor requires less training time, with an estimated 1-2 months.
- Hidden costs: React Native's native approach can incur additional costs for native module development, testing, and maintenance.

## FAQ
Q: Which framework is better for hybrid apps, Capacitor or React Native?
A: The choice between Capacitor and React Native depends on your team's specific needs, scalability requirements, and the type of hybrid app you're building. If you prioritize a web-based approach, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness, Capacitor might be the better choice. If you prioritize native performance, direct hardware access, and extensive community support, React Native might be the better choice.

Q: Can I use both Capacitor and React Native together?
A: Yes, you can use both Capacitor and React Native together, but it requires careful planning and integration. You can use Capacitor for web-based components and React Native for native components, but this approach can add complexity to your project.

Q: Which framework has better ROI for hybrid apps?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, Capacitor can provide a better ROI for small to medium-sized teams with limited budgets, with an estimated cost savings of 30-50% compared to React Native. However, for large enterprises with complex requirements, React Native's native performance and extensive community support can provide a better ROI in the long run, with an estimated cost savings of 10-20% compared to Capacitor.
