## When to Choose Astro
* If you're a small team (less than 10 people) with a limited budget, Astro's free, open-source model and unique "islands" architecture can help reduce costs and improve performance.
* If you're building a simple content site with limited scalability requirements, Astro's ease of use and built-in support for content formats like Markdown and MDX make it a great choice.
* If you're looking for a solution with minimal overhead and fast development time, Astro's islands architecture can help you get started quickly.
* For example, if you're a 10-person marketing agency needing a simple blog site, Astro can help you launch quickly and efficiently.

## When to Choose Next.js
* If you're a large team (more than 50 people) with complex requirements and a significant budget, Next.js provides the scalability, integrations, and support you need to build a high-performance content site.
* If you're building a complex content site with multiple authors, editors, and workflows, Next.js's extensive support for internationalization, accessibility, and SEO optimization makes it a great choice.
* If you're looking for a solution with a large, established ecosystem and extensive community resources, Next.js is a great option.
* For example, if you're a 100-person SaaS company needing a complex documentation site with multiple languages and workflows, Next.js can provide the scalability and support you need.

## Real-World Use Case: Content Sites
Let's say you're building a content site with 100 articles, 10 authors, and 1,000 daily visitors. With Astro, setup complexity is relatively low, taking around 2-3 days to get started. Ongoing maintenance burden is also minimal, with automatic code splitting and partial hydration reducing the need for manual optimization. Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $100-200 per month, depending on hosting and infrastructure costs. Common gotchas include limited support for complex workflows and internationalization.

With Next.js, setup complexity is higher, taking around 5-7 days to get started. Ongoing maintenance burden is also higher, with more extensive optimization and caching requirements. Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $500-1,000 per month, depending on hosting, infrastructure, and support costs. Common gotchas include steep learning curve and high overhead for small sites.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Astro and Next.js, data export/import limitations are relatively low, with both platforms supporting standard content formats like Markdown and JSON. Training time needed is around 1-3 weeks, depending on team size and complexity. Hidden costs include potential overhead from re-optimizing code and re-configuring workflows.

## FAQ
Q: Which platform has better performance for content sites?
A: Astro's islands architecture can reduce hydration time by up to 90%, resulting in faster page loads and improved user experience. However, Next.js's full hydration model can provide better support for complex, dynamic content.

Q: Can I use both Astro and Next.js together?
A: Yes, you can use both platforms together, with Astro handling static content and Next.js handling dynamic, interactive elements. However, this approach requires careful planning and optimization to avoid overhead and complexity.

Q: Which platform has better ROI for content sites?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, Astro can provide a better ROI for small to medium-sized content sites, with costs ranging from $1,200 to $3,600 per year. Next.js, on the other hand, can provide a better ROI for large, complex content sites, with costs ranging from $6,000 to $12,000 per year.
