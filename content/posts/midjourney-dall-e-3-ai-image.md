## Real-World Use Case: AI Image
Let's consider a scenario where a 10-person design team needs to generate 100 high-quality images for a marketing campaign. With Midjourney, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours/week. The cost breakdown would be approximately $300/month (based on $10/month per user). Common gotchas include the steep learning curve and limited integrations. In contrast, DALL-E 3 would require 1-2 days for setup, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 30 minutes/week. The cost breakdown would be around $450/month (based on $15/month per user). However, DALL-E 3's fast generation times and user-friendly interface make it a more accessible option.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Midjourney and DALL-E 3, data export/import limitations may apply, with Midjourney's proprietary format requiring additional processing time. Training time needed for DALL-E 3 would be significantly shorter, around 1-2 hours, compared to Midjourney's 5-10 hours. Hidden costs may include additional fees for priority support or custom integrations.
