# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two systems. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact and company data between HubSpot's marketing platform and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing contact and company data for streamlined sales and marketing processes

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Starter tier or higher)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Professional tier or higher)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, companies, deals)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot contacts to Salesforce contacts

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contacts are synchronized between HubSpot and Salesforce |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, when a contact is updated in Salesforce, the changes are synced back to HubSpot, ensuring that both systems have the most current information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure that all necessary fields are included in the sync configuration

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for quick intervention and minimizing data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain advanced data types may not sync between HubSpot and Salesforce.
- **Rate Limits:** Both HubSpot and Salesforce have rate limits on API calls, which can affect sync frequency and volume.
- **Feature Gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot and the lower tiers of Salesforce may have limited integration capabilities compared to higher tiers.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: Limited integration capabilities are available with the free tier, but for full functionality, a Starter tier or higher is required.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some syncs may be scheduled (e.g., every 15 minutes) depending on the configuration and rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced, but this may require a one-time backfill process or using a third-party integration service for larger datasets.
