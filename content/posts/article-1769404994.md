# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information and sales activity between the two systems, ensuring that both teams have a unified view of the customer.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing contact information and sales activity between HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure a unified view of the customer.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, including contact information and sales activity

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead information is synchronized between the two systems |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a deal is closed. This bidirectional data flow ensures that both systems have the most up-to-date information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure that all necessary fields are included in the sync

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This allows you to quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise.

## Limitations to Know
- HubSpot's free tier does not support Salesforce integration
- Salesforce has rate limits on API calls, which can impact sync frequency
- The native integration does not support syncing custom objects

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need to have at least a Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier to use this integration.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but you can also schedule syncs to occur at specific intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data, but this may require additional setup and configuration. It's recommended to consult with a HubSpot or Salesforce expert to ensure a smooth data migration.
