## Real-World Use Case: Authorization
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to authorize access to sensitive customer data for a 100-person SaaS company. With Cerbos, setup complexity is relatively low, taking around 2-3 days to get started. Ongoing maintenance burden is also minimal, with automated policy updates and a user-friendly interface. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $0 (free, open-source) for Cerbos, while OPA's cost is also $0 (free, open-source). However, common gotchas with Cerbos include limited scalability and a smaller community compared to OPA.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Cerbos and OPA, data export/import limitations are minimal, with both tools supporting standard formats like JSON and YAML. Training time needed is around 1-2 weeks for OPA, while Cerbos requires minimal training. Hidden costs include potential enterprise support fees and custom development costs for integrating with existing systems.
