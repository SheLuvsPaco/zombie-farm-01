# How to Migrate from Wix to WordPress (Step-by-Step)

Migrating your website from Wix to WordPress can be a daunting task, but with a clear plan and the right tools, you can ensure a smooth transition. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of migrating your data from Wix to WordPress, including a 301 redirect mapping strategy to preserve your SEO history.

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Backup Wix data: Export your Wix data as a CSV or JSON file to ensure you have a copy of your content, including pages, posts, and other relevant information. This process typically takes around 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of your website.
- [ ] Create WordPress account: Sign up for a WordPress account, either trial or paid, to host your migrated website. The cost of a WordPress account varies depending on the plan you choose, but the basic plan starts at $4 per month.
- [ ] Map your fields: Create a mapping document to match your Wix fields with the corresponding fields in WordPress. For example, "Deal Name" in Wix might correspond to "Opportunity" in WordPress. This step is crucial to ensure that your data is correctly transferred and can take around 30 minutes to an hour to complete, depending on the complexity of your data.
- [ ] Inform your team of downtime: Notify your team and stakeholders about the expected downtime during the migration process, which can range from 2-5 hours, depending on the size of your website and the method you choose.

## Method 1: The "One-Click" Importer (If available)
Unfortunately, WordPress does not have a native import tool specifically designed for Wix. However, some third-party plugins, such as All-In-One WP Migration or WP Import, offer one-click import functionality for Wix websites. If you choose to use one of these plugins, the steps are as follows:
- Install and activate the plugin on your WordPress website.
- Follow the plugin's instructions to connect your Wix website and initiate the import process.
- Monitor the import process and address any errors or issues that arise.

## Method 2: Manual CSV Export/Import (The Reliable Way)
1. **Export from Wix:** Navigate to Settings > Data Management > Export in your Wix dashboard and download your data as a CSV file. This process typically takes around 5-10 minutes, depending on the size of your website.
2. **Clean the Data:** Open the exported CSV file in Excel and remove any empty rows or unnecessary data to ensure a smooth import process. This step can take around 15-30 minutes, depending on the size and complexity of your data.
3. **Import to WordPress:** Go to Settings > Import > CSV in your WordPress dashboard and upload the cleaned CSV file. Follow the import wizard to map your fields and complete the import process. This step can take around 10-30 minutes, depending on the size of your data.
4. **Map Fields:** Ensure that the columns in your CSV file match the corresponding fields in WordPress. This step is crucial to prevent data loss or corruption during the import process.

## Critical: What DOESN'T Transfer?
When migrating from Wix to WordPress, some data may not transfer automatically, including:
- Notes: Wix notes may not be imported directly into WordPress. You can manually copy and paste notes into WordPress or use a third-party plugin to import them.
- File attachments: File attachments, such as images or documents, may not be transferred during the import process. You can manually upload these files to WordPress or use a plugin to import them.
- Activity logs: Activity logs, such as page views or user interactions, may not be transferred during the migration process. You can use analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to track activity on your WordPress website.

## Post-Migration Testing
After completing the migration, it's essential to test your WordPress website to ensure that everything is working as expected:
- Verify record counts: Check that the number of records, such as pages or posts, matches the original count in Wix. For example, if you had 500 leads in Wix, you should have 500 leads in WordPress.
- Check standard and custom fields: Verify that all standard and custom fields, such as titles, descriptions, and meta tags, have been correctly transferred and are functioning as expected.

## FAQ
Q: How long does this take?
A: The migration process can take anywhere from 2-10 hours, depending on the size of your website and the method you choose. For example, migrating a small website with 1,000 records can take around 2-3 hours, while migrating a large website with 10,000 records can take around 5-10 hours.

Q: Will I lose my SEO/History?
A: To preserve your SEO history, it's essential to implement a 301 redirect mapping strategy. This involves creating a mapping document that matches the URLs of your Wix website with the corresponding URLs on your WordPress website. You can then use a plugin, such as Redirection or Yoast SEO, to implement the 301 redirects and preserve your SEO history. Additionally, you can use a tool like Ahrefs or SEMrush to monitor your website's SEO performance and identify any potential issues. By following these steps, you can minimize the impact of the migration on your SEO and ensure a smooth transition for your website.
