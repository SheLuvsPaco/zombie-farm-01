# Automating Design Handoff: A Guide for Figma and Asana
As a B2B Integration Architect, I'll explain how to integrate Figma and Asana to streamline design handoff, reducing manual effort and increasing productivity. This integration offers a significant return on investment (ROI) for B2B teams by automating feedback loops and improving collaboration between designers and project managers.

## Introduction
The integration of Figma and Asana enables design teams to automatically share design files, receive feedback, and track project progress. This streamlined process saves time, reduces errors, and enhances overall team efficiency.

## Feature Comparison
| Feature | Figma Capability | Asana Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Design File Management | Cloud-based design file storage and collaboration | Task management and project tracking |
| Feedback and Commenting | Real-time commenting and feedback on design files | Task assignment and commenting for feedback |
| Project Management | Limited project management features | Comprehensive project management and tracking |

## Technical Prerequisites
To integrate Figma and Asana, you'll need:
* Figma API access with a valid API token
* Asana API access with a valid API token
* Webhooks set up in both Figma and Asana to enable real-time notifications

## The Workflow
Here's a 5-step logic flow for the integration:
1. When a designer updates a design file in Figma, a webhook triggers a notification to Asana.
2. Asana creates a new task with a link to the updated design file.
3. The project manager assigns the task to the relevant team member for review.
4. The team member reviews the design file and provides feedback in Asana.
5. The designer receives the feedback in Asana and updates the design file in Figma.

## Best Practices
To ensure a smooth integration, follow these best practices:
* Use secure API tokens and webhooks to protect your data.
* Set up a regular sync frequency to ensure data consistency between Figma and Asana.
> [!TIP]
> **Pro-Tip:** Use a sync frequency of at least every 15 minutes to ensure timely updates and feedback.
