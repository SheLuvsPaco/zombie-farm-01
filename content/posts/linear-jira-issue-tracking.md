## Real-World Use Case: Issue Tracking
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person dev team needs to track issues across multiple projects. With Linear, setup takes around 2 hours, and ongoing maintenance is minimal, with a cost of $300/month for 20 users. In contrast, Jira requires around 5 days to set up, with a higher cost of $750/month for 20 users. However, Jira offers more advanced features, such as custom fields and workflow automation, which can be beneficial for larger teams. Common gotchas include setting up custom workflows and integrating with other tools, which can be time-consuming.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Linear to Jira, data export/import limitations include a maximum of 1000 issues per export, and training time needed is around 1-2 weeks. Hidden costs include the need for additional support and customization, which can add up to $1000/month. On the other hand, switching from Jira to Linear requires minimal training, around 1-2 days, but may require significant customization to simplify workflows.
