# Free ClickUp Sprint Planning Board Template (2026 Blueprint)

## Why You Need This Template
- Building a Sprint Planning Board from scratch can waste up to 5 hours of your time, taking away from the actual planning and execution of your projects. This is because you have to set up the board, configure the columns, and establish the automations, which can be tedious and prone to errors.
- This template handles the Agile workflow with pre-set automations, allowing you to focus on your project's goals and objectives. It automates tasks such as moving tasks to the next column when their status changes, sending notifications to team members, and updating the board with new tasks.
- This template is ideal for freelancers, agencies, and small to medium-sized businesses that want to streamline their project planning process and improve team collaboration. It's particularly useful for teams that follow the Agile methodology and want to reduce the time spent on planning and increase the time spent on actual project work.

## Template Features Breakdown
- **Core View 1:** The main dashboard of this template is a Kanban board that displays all the tasks and projects in different columns, representing the various stages of the sprint. The board is customizable, allowing you to add or remove columns as needed, and you can filter tasks by assignee, priority, and due date. For example, you can use the "Filter" feature to show only the tasks assigned to a specific team member or the tasks with a high priority.
- **Automation:** The template includes pre-built automations that streamline the workflow, such as automatically moving tasks to the next column when their status changes, sending notifications to team members when a task is assigned to them, and updating the board with new tasks. These automations are based on specific conditions, such as when a task is marked as "done" or when a new task is added to the board. For instance, you can set up an automation to send a notification to the team when a task is moved to the "In Progress" column.
- **Fields Included:** The template includes key data points such as task name, description, assignee, priority, due date, and status. You can also add custom fields as needed, such as estimated time, dependencies, and tags. For example, you can add a custom field to track the estimated time required to complete a task or to identify the dependencies between tasks.

For instance, you can rename the "To-Do" column to "Backlog" or the "Done" column to "Completed".
3. **Connect:** Integrate with Product Management if needed by clicking on the "Integrate" button and selecting the relevant integration. This allows you to connect your Sprint Planning Board to other tools and platforms, such as Trello or Asana, and to sync data between them.

## "Supercharge" This Template
> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip:** Connect this template to an automation tool like n8n to auto-fill rows from your email. This allows you to automate tasks such as creating new tasks from email notifications or updating existing tasks with new information. For example, you can set up an automation to create a new task in the Sprint Planning Board when you receive an email with a specific subject line or keyword.
