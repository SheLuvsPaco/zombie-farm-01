# How to Migrate from Teachable to Kajabi (Step-by-Step)

Migrating your data from Teachable to Kajabi can be a complex process, but with the right approach, you can ensure a safe and successful transfer of your student data and progress. In this guide, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of migrating from Teachable to Kajabi, highlighting the benefits of retaining student data and progress.

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Backup Teachable data (Export as CSV/JSON): This is a crucial step to ensure that you have a copy of your data in case anything goes wrong during the migration process. Teachable allows you to export your data in CSV or JSON format, which can be done by going to Settings > Data Management > Export.
- [ ] Create Kajabi account (Trial/Paid): Before you start the migration process, you need to have a Kajabi account. You can sign up for a trial or paid account, depending on your needs.
- [ ] Map your fields (e.g., "Deal Name" in Teachable = "Opportunity" in Kajabi): It's essential to map your fields correctly to ensure that your data is transferred accurately. For example, if you have a field called "Deal Name" in Teachable, you need to map it to the corresponding field in Kajabi, which might be called "Opportunity".
- [ ] Inform your team of downtime: It's crucial to inform your team about the migration process and the expected downtime. This will help minimize disruptions and ensure a smooth transition.

## Method 1: The "One-Click" Importer (If available)
Kajabi does not have a native one-click import tool for Teachable. However, they do offer a CSV import feature that can be used to migrate your data. If you're looking for a more automated solution, you can consider using a third-party integration tool like Zapier or Integromat.

## Method 2: Manual CSV Export/Import (The Reliable Way)
1. **Export from Teachable:** Settings > Data Management > Export. This will allow you to export your data in CSV format, which can then be imported into Kajabi.
2. **Clean the Data:** Remove empty rows in Excel. It's essential to clean your data before importing it into Kajabi to ensure that it's accurate and consistent.
3. **Import to Kajabi:** Settings > Import > CSV. Kajabi allows you to import your data in CSV format, which can be done by going to Settings > Import > CSV.
4. **Map Fields:** Ensure columns match perfectly. As mentioned earlier, it's crucial to map your fields correctly to ensure that your data is transferred accurately.

## Critical: What DOESN'T Transfer?
- Notes: Teachable notes will not transfer to Kajabi. You can manually export and import them as a separate CSV file.
- File attachments: File attachments will not transfer to Kajabi. You can manually download and re-upload them to Kajabi.
- Activity logs: Activity logs will not transfer to Kajabi. You can manually export and import them as a separate CSV file.

To move these manually or via API, you can use the following approaches:

* Notes: Export notes from Teachable as a CSV file and then import them into Kajabi as a separate entity.
* File attachments: Download file attachments from Teachable and re-upload them to Kajabi.
* Activity logs: Export activity logs from Teachable as a CSV file and then import them into Kajabi as a separate entity.

## Post-Migration Testing
- Verify record counts (Teachable had 500 leads, Kajabi should have 500): It's essential to verify that all your records have been transferred correctly.
- Check standard and custom fields: Ensure that all your standard and custom fields have been mapped correctly and are displaying the correct data.

## FAQ
Q: How long does this take?
A: The migration process can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the amount of data you have. For example, if you have 1,000 records, the migration process can take around 30 minutes. However, if you have 10,000 records, the process can take around 2-3 hours.

Q: Will I lose my SEO/History?
A: When migrating from Teachable to Kajabi, you may lose some of your SEO history, as Kajabi uses a different URL structure. However, you can minimize the impact by setting up 301 redirects from your old Teachable URLs to your new Kajabi URLs. This will help preserve your SEO rankings and ensure a smooth transition for your users.

By following these steps and considering the potential limitations, you can ensure a safe and successful migration of your data from Teachable to Kajabi, retaining your student data and progress.
