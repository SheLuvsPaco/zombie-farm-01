## Real-World Use Case: Validation
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to validate user input for a simple web application. With Vest, setup complexity is minimal (less than 1 hour), and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low (less than 1 hour per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is $0 (free, open-source). However, common gotchas include limited advanced validation features and potential community support limitations. In contrast, Zod requires more setup complexity (2-3 hours) and ongoing maintenance burden (2-3 hours per week), but provides more advanced validation features and priority support. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is $99/month (paid plan).

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Vest and Zod, data export/import limitations are relatively minimal, as both tools use standard JSON formats. However, training time needed to adapt to the new tool's syntax and features can range from 1-7 days, depending on the team's size and complexity of the application. Hidden costs include potential paid support or consulting fees to ensure a smooth transition.
