# Does GitLab Have CI/CD? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
GitLab has a built-in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) feature, allowing users to automate their build, test, and deployment pipeline. This feature is a key part of GitLab's DevOps capabilities, enabling teams to streamline their development workflow and reduce time-to-market.

## How to Use CI/CD in GitLab
1. Navigate to your GitLab project's **CI/CD** section, typically found in the left-hand menu.
2. Click on **Pipelines** to create a new pipeline or edit an existing one, and then define your CI/CD workflow using GitLab's YAML-based configuration file (.gitlab-ci.yml).
3. Result: Your pipeline will automatically trigger and run according to your defined stages, jobs, and scripts, providing real-time feedback and logs.

## Workarounds (Not Applicable)
Since GitLab has native CI/CD support, there is no need for workarounds. However, for users looking to integrate with other tools or extend GitLab's CI/CD capabilities, there are various integrations and plugins available.

## Better Alternatives for CI/CD
If you're evaluating alternatives for CI/CD, consider the following tools:
- **Alternative 1:** CircleCI (Native support with a strong focus on automation and scalability)
- **Alternative 2:** Jenkins (Better implementation with extensive plugin ecosystem and community support)

## FAQ
Q: Is CI/CD coming in the roadmap?
A: GitLab's CI/CD feature is already available and continuously improved upon, with new features and enhancements added regularly, as seen in their public roadmap.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, GitLab's CI/CD feature is available in all tiers, including the free plan, although some advanced features and support may require a higher-tier subscription, such as GitLab Premium or Ultimate.
