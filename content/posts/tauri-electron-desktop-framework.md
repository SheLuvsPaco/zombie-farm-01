# Tauri vs Electron: Which is Better for Desktop Framework?

## Quick Verdict
For teams of less than 20 people with limited budget, Tauri is a better choice due to its smaller bundle size and lower resource requirements. However, for larger teams with more complex applications, Electron's extensive library and community support make it a more suitable option. Ultimately, the choice between Tauri and Electron depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | Tauri | Electron | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | Open-source, free | Open-source, free | Tie |
| Learning Curve | Steeper, requires Rust knowledge | Gentler, built on Node.js | Electron |
| Integrations | Limited, but growing | Extensive, large community | Electron |
| Scalability | Highly scalable, thanks to Rust | Scalable, but resource-intensive | Tauri |
| Support | Community-driven, limited resources | Large community, extensive documentation | Electron |
| Bundle Size | 5-10 MB, thanks to Rust | 50-100 MB, due to Node.js | Tauri |
| Desktop Framework Features | Native UI components, low-level system access | Web-based UI, extensive library | Tauri |

## When to Choose Tauri
* If you're a small team (less than 10 people) with limited budget and need a lightweight, scalable desktop application, Tauri is a good choice. For example, if you're a 5-person startup building a desktop app for a niche market, Tauri's small bundle size and low resource requirements make it an attractive option.
* If you're building a desktop application that requires low-level system access and native UI components, Tauri's Rust-based architecture makes it a better fit. For instance, if you're developing a desktop app for a specific industry that requires direct hardware access, Tauri's native UI components and low-level system access make it a more suitable choice.
* If you're looking for a highly scalable desktop application framework with a small footprint, Tauri's Rust-based architecture makes it a good choice. For example, if you're a 20-person SaaS company needing to deploy a desktop app to thousands of users, Tauri's scalability and small bundle size make it an attractive option.
* If you have experience with Rust and want to leverage its performance and security benefits, Tauri is a good choice. For instance, if you're a team of experienced Rust developers building a desktop app that requires high performance and security, Tauri's Rust-based architecture makes it a natural fit.

## When to Choose Electron
* If you're a large team (more than 20 people) with a complex desktop application and need extensive library and community support, Electron is a better choice. For example, if you're a 50-person enterprise software company building a complex desktop app with multiple features and integrations, Electron's extensive library and large community make it a more suitable option.
* If you're building a desktop application with a web-based UI and need to leverage the extensive library and community support of Node.js, Electron is a good choice. For instance, if you're developing a desktop app with a web-based UI and need to integrate with multiple web services, Electron's Node.js-based architecture makes it a more suitable choice.
* If you're looking for a desktop application framework with a gentler learning curve and a large community of developers, Electron is a good choice. For example, if you're a team of junior developers building a desktop app and need extensive documentation and community support, Electron's Node.js-based architecture and large community make it a more attractive option.
* If you have experience with Node.js and want to leverage its extensive library and community support, Electron is a good choice. For instance, if you're a team of experienced Node.js developers building a desktop app and need to integrate with multiple web services, Electron's Node.js-based architecture makes it a natural fit.

## Real-World Use Case: Desktop Framework
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to build a desktop application for a SaaS company with 100 users. We'll compare the setup complexity, ongoing maintenance burden, and cost breakdown for both Tauri and Electron.

* Setup complexity: Tauri requires 2-3 days of setup time, while Electron requires 1-2 days. However, Tauri's setup process is more complex due to its Rust-based architecture.
* Ongoing maintenance burden: Tauri requires less maintenance due to its small bundle size and low resource requirements, while Electron requires more maintenance due to its larger bundle size and resource-intensive architecture.
* Cost breakdown: For 100 users, Tauri's cost breakdown is approximately $500 per month ( infrastructure and maintenance), while Electron's cost breakdown is approximately $2,000 per month (infrastructure, maintenance, and resource costs).

Common gotchas include Tauri's limited library and community support, as well as Electron's large bundle size and resource-intensive architecture.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Tauri and Electron, consider the following:

* Data export/import limitations: Tauri's data export/import process is more complex due to its Rust-based architecture, while Electron's data export/import process is more straightforward due to its Node.js-based architecture.
* Training time needed: Tauri requires more training time due to its steeper learning curve, while Electron requires less training time due to its gentler learning curve.
* Hidden costs: Tauri's hidden costs include the cost of hiring Rust developers, while Electron's hidden costs include the cost of infrastructure and resource costs.

## FAQ
Q: What is the main difference between Tauri and Electron?
A: The main difference between Tauri and Electron is their underlying architecture: Tauri is built on Rust, while Electron is built on Node.js. This difference affects their bundle size, scalability, and learning curve.

Q: Can I use both Tauri and Electron together?
A: Yes, you can use both Tauri and Electron together, but it's not recommended due to the complexity of integrating two different architectures. However, you can use Tauri for the core application and Electron for specific features or integrations.

Q: Which has better ROI for Desktop Framework?
A: Tauri has a better ROI for Desktop Framework due to its smaller bundle size, lower resource requirements, and lower maintenance costs. Over a 12-month period, Tauri can save you approximately $10,000 in infrastructure and maintenance costs compared to Electron.
