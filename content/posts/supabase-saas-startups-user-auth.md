# Accelerating SaaS Startup Success with Supabase: A User Authentication Guide
As a SaaS startup, launching a minimum viable product (MVP) quickly is crucial to test your idea, gather feedback, and iterate towards success. However, implementing user authentication can be a significant bottleneck, delaying your launch by weeks or even months. Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase, offers a robust and scalable solution to streamline user authentication, enabling you to launch your MVP up to 70% faster.

## Understanding User Authentication Challenges
Implementing user authentication from scratch can be a daunting task, requiring significant development time and resources. A custom-built solution can take around 12-16 weeks to develop, with an estimated cost of $60,000 to $80,000. In contrast, Supabase provides a pre-built authentication system that can be integrated into your application in a matter of days, reducing development time by 90% and costs by 80%.
