# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manually updating calendars with task deadlines and due dates. This integration automates the process, reducing the time spent on manual updates. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Managing project deadlines and team schedules

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both tools

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as mapping Trello cards to Google Calendar events

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., "New Card")
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., "Create Event")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Trello to Google Calendar
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New Card in Trello | Create Event in Google Calendar | Automated calendar updates with task deadlines |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Google Calendar events can also be synced back to Trello, allowing for bidirectional data flow. For example, updating an event in Google Calendar can update the corresponding Trello card.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the Trello card title is mapped to the Google Calendar event title

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap/Scenario that triggers on sync errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's native integration with Google Calendar only supports syncing of card titles, descriptions, and due dates. Other card fields, such as comments and attachments, are not synced.
- Google Calendar has a rate limit of 1000 requests per day for free accounts, which can be exceeded if syncing a large number of Trello cards.
- The free tier of Trello has limited integration capabilities, while the paid tier offers more advanced features, such as custom field mapping.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier?
A: Yes, the integration works with the free tier of Trello, but with limited features.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to avoid rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced, but this may require manual configuration and may be subject to rate limits.
