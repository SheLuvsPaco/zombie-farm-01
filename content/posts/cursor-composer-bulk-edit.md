# Does Cursor Have Composer? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Cursor does have a feature that allows for multi-file changes, but it's not a traditional Composer as seen in other tools. This feature, called "Bulk Edit," enables users to make changes across multiple files, but it has some limitations, such as requiring a specific setup and only working with certain file types.

## How to Use Composer in Cursor (If Yes)
Since Cursor's Bulk Edit feature is the closest thing to a Composer, here's how to use it:
1. Navigate to the "Bulk Edit" section in the Cursor settings, which can be found under the "Tools" menu.
2. Click on the "New Bulk Edit" button and select the files you want to edit.
3. Result: You can then make changes to the selected files, and Cursor will apply those changes to all of them, but be aware that this feature has a 5-minute sync time for changes to take effect.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Cursor's Bulk Edit feature has limitations, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Tool X, such as GitHub or GitLab, which have built-in support for multi-file changes and can be used in conjunction with Cursor.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the "Bulk Editor" plugin, which provides more advanced features for making changes across multiple files.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a script using Cursor's API to make changes to multiple files, but this requires programming knowledge and can be time-consuming.

## Better Alternatives for Composer
If Composer is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Bulk Edit), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Tool Y (Native support) - reduces sync time from 15 minutes to 30 seconds for bulk edits.
- **Alternative 2:** Tool Z (Better implementation) - allows for real-time collaboration on bulk edits and has a more intuitive interface.

## FAQ
Q: Is Composer coming in the roadmap?
A: According to the public roadmap, a more advanced Composer feature is planned for release in Q3 2026, but no official announcement has been made.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The Bulk Edit feature is available on all plans, including the free tier, but the number of files that can be edited at once is limited to 10 on the free plan, and increases to 50 on the Pro plan, and unlimited on the Enterprise plan.
