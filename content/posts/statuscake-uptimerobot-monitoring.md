## Real-World Use Case: Monitoring
Let's say you're a 20-person e-commerce company with an online store that needs to be monitored for uptime and performance across multiple regions. With StatusCake, setting up monitoring for your store would take around 2 hours, including configuring checks and alerts. Ongoing maintenance would require around 1 hour per week to review reports and adjust settings as needed. The cost for 100 users and 100 checks would be around $50/month. With UptimeRobot, setup would take around 1 hour, and ongoing maintenance would require around 30 minutes per week. The cost for 100 users and 100 monitors would be around $20/month. However, UptimeRobot's limited multi-region monitoring capabilities might lead to blind spots in your monitoring coverage.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from UptimeRobot to StatusCake, you'll need to export your monitoring data and reconfigure your checks and alerts, which can take around 2-3 hours. StatusCake provides a migration guide and support team to help with the transition. However, you may incur additional costs for custom setup and training, which can range from $100 to $500. If switching from StatusCake to UptimeRobot, you'll need to simplify your monitoring setup and adjust to UptimeRobot's more limited feature set, which can take around 1-2 hours.
