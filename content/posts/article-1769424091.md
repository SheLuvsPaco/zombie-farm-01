# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the synchronization of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize lead status updates in real-time, ensuring that both sales and marketing teams have the most up-to-date information.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing lead status updates between HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure data consistency and reduce manual data entry.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts) and setting the sync frequency (e.g., every 15 minutes)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot contact properties to Salesforce contact fields

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New lead created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead is synced between HubSpot and Salesforce, with all relevant fields populated |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a sales representative updates a lead's status in Salesforce, the change can be synced back to HubSpot, ensuring that marketing teams have the latest information on lead engagement and readiness to buy.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens, ensuring that the authentication process is completed correctly and that all necessary permissions are granted.
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 30 minutes to avoid hitting Salesforce's API rate limits, which can temporarily block integration functionality.
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping to ensure that all necessary fields are correctly mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce, preventing data loss during synchronization.

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for prompt action to resolve issues and minimize data inconsistencies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom object types in Salesforce may not sync with HubSpot due to compatibility issues.
- **Rate Limits:** Salesforce has API rate limits that can affect the frequency of data synchronization, potentially causing delays in real-time updates.
- **Feature Gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration, requiring at least a Professional tier subscription for full functionality.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need at least a Professional tier subscription.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data can sync in real-time or on a scheduled basis (e.g., every 15 minutes), depending on the configuration and the specific needs of your workflow.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can backfill historical data from one platform to the other, but this may require additional setup and configuration to ensure data integrity and consistency.
