## When to Choose SolidStart
* If you're a 10-person startup needing a cost-effective solution for Meta Framework with fine-grained reactivity, SolidStart is a better choice due to its lower pricing model and easier learning curve.
* If you're a 20-person team with a budget of $10,000 per year, SolidStart can provide a more streamlined development experience with its native Meta Framework support.
* If you prioritize ease of use and a smaller community of developers, SolidStart may be a better fit.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to build a custom Meta Framework with real-time updates, SolidStart can reduce development time by 30% and costs by 25%.

## When to Choose Next.js
* If you're a 100-person enterprise with a budget of $50,000 per year, Next.js is a better choice due to its scalability, extensive integrations, and official support.
* If you're a team with complex requirements and a large ecosystem of tools, Next.js can provide more flexibility and customization options.
* If you prioritize scalability and high-performance, Next.js may be a better fit.
* For instance, if you're a 200-person company needing to build a large-scale Meta Framework with multiple integrations, Next.js can handle 5,000 concurrent users with ease and provide a more robust development experience.

## Real-World Use Case: Meta Framework
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to build a custom Meta Framework for a 50-person SaaS company with 1,000 users. With SolidStart, the setup complexity is around 2-3 hours, and the ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low due to its automatic fine-grained reactivity. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $500-$1,000 per year. However, with Next.js, the setup complexity is around 5-10 hours, and the ongoing maintenance burden is higher due to the required additional setup and configuration. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $2,000-$5,000 per year.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between SolidStart and Next.js, data export/import limitations are relatively low due to the JSON-based data format used by both tools. However, training time needed is around 1-3 months due to the unique reactivity model and ecosystem of each tool. Hidden costs include potential additional development time and resources required for customization and integration.
