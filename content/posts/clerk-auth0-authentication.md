## Real-World Use Case: Authentication
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to authenticate 100 users for a web application. With Clerk, setup complexity is relatively low, taking around 2 hours to integrate. Ongoing maintenance burden is also minimal, with automatic updates and monitoring. The cost breakdown for 100 users is $39/month, with no additional fees. However, common gotchas include limited customization options and potential issues with user onboarding. With Auth0, setup complexity is higher, taking around 5 days to integrate, and ongoing maintenance burden is more significant due to the need for custom configuration and monitoring. The cost breakdown for 100 users is $1,000/month, with additional fees for advanced features. However, Auth0's platform provides more extensive customization options and advanced security features.
