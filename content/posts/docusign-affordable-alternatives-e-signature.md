# Affordable e-Signature Solutions: Exploring Alternatives to DocuSign
The rising demand for digital document signing has led to a surge in the adoption of e-signature tools like DocuSign. However, for many businesses and individuals, the cost per envelope can be prohibitively expensive, especially when dealing with a high volume of documents. This guide explores affordable alternatives to DocuSign, focusing on lowering the cost per envelope without compromising on features and security.

## Understanding e-Signature Costs
When evaluating e-signature solutions, it's essential to consider the cost per envelope, as this can quickly add up. DocuSign, for example, charges $25 per month for its standard plan, which includes 100 documents. However, this cost can increase significantly if you exceed the document limit or require additional features. In contrast, affordable alternatives can offer similar functionality at a lower cost per envelope.

## Comparing e-Signature Solutions
The following table compares the features and pricing of DocuSign with two affordable alternatives: SignNow and PandaDoc.

| Solution | Cost per Month | Cost per Envelope | Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DocuSign | $25 | $0.25 | Electronic signatures, document templates, workflows |
| SignNow | $8 | $0.08 | Electronic signatures, document templates, workflows, API integration |
| PandaDoc | $19 | $0.15 | Electronic signatures, document templates, workflows, content library |

As shown in the table, SignNow offers a significantly lower cost per envelope than DocuSign, making it an attractive option for businesses with high document volumes. PandaDoc also offers a lower cost per envelope than DocuSign, with additional features like a content library.

## Step-by-Step Implementation
Implementing an e-signature solution is relatively straightforward. Here's a step-by-step process for getting started with SignNow:

1. **Sign up**: Create an account on the SignNow website and choose a plan that suits your needs.
2. **Upload documents**: Upload your documents to the SignNow platform, either individually or in bulk.
3. **Create templates**: Create document templates with fillable fields and electronic signature blocks.
4. **Send documents**: Send documents to recipients via email, with options for reminders and notifications.
5. **Track progress**: Track the status of your documents in real-time, with notifications when a document is signed or completed.

## Real-World Example
A real estate company was using DocuSign to manage its document signing process, with an average of 500 documents per month. By switching to SignNow, the company was able to reduce its monthly costs from $125 (500 documents x $0.25 per envelope) to $40 (500 documents x $0.08 per envelope), resulting in a cost savings of $85 per month.

## Practical Tips
When evaluating affordable e-signature solutions, consider the following tips:

* **Calculate your document volume**: Estimate the number of documents you'll need to sign per month to determine the most cost-effective solution.
* **Evaluate features**: Consider the features you need, such as document templates, workflows, and API integration.
* **Check security**: Ensure the solution you choose has robust security measures in place, such as encryption and two-factor authentication.

## Frequently Asked Questions
