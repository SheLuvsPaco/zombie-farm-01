# 5 Best Helpdesk Tools for IT Teams in 2026

## Why IT Teams Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they lack the specialized features required for efficient internal support, such as asset management integration, which is crucial for tracking and managing IT assets across the organization.
- IT Teams specifically need Internal Support to ensure that their internal operations run smoothly, and that any technical issues are resolved quickly to minimize downtime.
- We tested these tools for asset management integration, evaluating how well they can track, manage, and report on IT assets, as well as integrate with existing asset management systems.

A: Yes, a dedicated helpdesk tool can save IT teams up to 40% of their time spent on support requests, by automating routine tasks, providing a centralized platform for ticket management, and enabling better reporting and analytics. For example, a study by HDI found that IT teams that use a dedicated helpdesk tool can resolve tickets up to 30% faster than those that use generic tools or email-based support systems. Additionally, a dedicated helpdesk tool can help IT teams to improve their first-call resolution rate, reduce the mean time to resolve (MTTR), and increase customer satisfaction.
