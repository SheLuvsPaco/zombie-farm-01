# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the synchronization of contact, lead, and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize lead scoring and qualification data from HubSpot with opportunity management in Salesforce.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing lead qualification and opportunity management between marketing and sales teams.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or a scenario in Make (formerly Integromat)
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, including contact, lead, and account information

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Qualification
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New lead is qualified in HubSpot | Create a new opportunity in Salesforce | Automated handoff from marketing to sales |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, such as updating contact information in both HubSpot and Salesforce when it changes in either platform, use the native integration's two-way sync feature or configure a separate Zap/Scenario for reverse syncing.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by reconnecting the integration
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to comply with API rate limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure all necessary fields are synced between the two platforms

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for quick intervention and minimizing data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- Custom objects in Salesforce may not sync with HubSpot due to limitations in the native integration.
- Rate limits apply to both HubSpot and Salesforce APIs, which can slow down sync times during periods of high activity.
- Feature gaps between tiers, such as the absence of custom object syncing in lower tiers, may impact the effectiveness of the integration.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot or Salesforce?
A: No, the integration requires at least the Professional tier of HubSpot and the Enterprise tier of Salesforce.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some actions may be scheduled to comply with API rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, the integration allows for backfilling historical data from one platform to the other, but this may require additional setup and can be subject to API rate limits.
