# Stripe Pricing 2026: The True Cost Explained

As a B2B procurement consultant, it's essential to understand the true cost of using Stripe as a payment gateway. While Stripe's official pricing tiers may seem straightforward, there are hidden costs and factors to consider, particularly when it comes to international currency conversion.

## The Official Tiers (Simplified)
| Plan | Price | Key Limit | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | $0 | 1% + 30¢ per transaction | Testing |
| Starter | $9/month | 1% + 30¢ per transaction, 500 transactions per month | Solopreneurs |
| Pro | $49/month | 1% + 30¢ per transaction, 10,000 transactions per month | Scaling Teams |

## The "Hidden" Costs They Don't Mention
- **Seat Costs:** Stripe's pricing is not per user, but rather per account. However, if you have multiple users accessing the dashboard, you may need to pay extra for additional logins or roles.
- **Add-ons:** API access is included in all plans, but you may need to pay extra for features like Stripe Radar (fraud detection) or Stripe Sigma (analytics).
- **Overage Fees:** If you exceed the transaction limit on your plan, you'll be charged an additional 0.5% per transaction. Furthermore, international currency conversion fees can range from 1-3% per transaction, depending on the currency and location. For example, if you're processing $10,000 in transactions per month in Euros, you may incur an additional $100-$300 in conversion fees.

## Comparison: Is it Worth It?
- vs Competitor A (PayPal): PayPal's transaction fees are similar to Stripe's, but they charge an additional 1.5% cross-border fee for international transactions. Stripe's conversion fees may be lower, but PayPal's fees are more transparent.
- vs Competitor B (Braintree): Braintree's pricing is more complex, with a $0.10 per transaction fee and a 2.9% + 0.30¢ per transaction fee for international transactions. However, Braintree offers more advanced features, such as support for multiple payment methods and currencies.

## Strategic Recommendation
- **Buy the Pro plan if:** You need advanced features like Stripe Radar or Stripe Sigma, or if you're processing more than 10,000 transactions per month.
- **Stay on Free if:** You have less than 500 transactions per month and don't need additional features or support.
- **Negotiation Tip:** If you're an enterprise customer processing more than $100,000 per month, you may be able to negotiate a custom pricing plan with Stripe. Be sure to ask about discounts for high-volume transactions or long-term commitments.

## FAQ
Q: Is there a startup discount?
A: Yes, Stripe offers a startup discount program for eligible companies, which can provide up to 50% off the Pro plan for the first year.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
A: Yes, Stripe plans can be canceled at any time, but you'll need to provide 30 days' notice to avoid being charged for the next month. Additionally, if you're using Stripe's payment processing services, you may need to wait up to 90 days for any pending transactions to clear before your account is fully closed.
