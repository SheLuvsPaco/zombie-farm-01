# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information, lead status, and sales activity between HubSpot's marketing automation platform and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, including email, phone number, and company name

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information synchronized between platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a deal is closed or a contact's status is updated. This bidirectional data flow ensures that both systems have the most up-to-date information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, including custom fields

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a custom webhook in HubSpot or Salesforce that sends notifications to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- Custom objects and fields may not sync between platforms
- Salesforce has a rate limit of 1,000 API calls per day for the Enterprise tier
- The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need to have at least the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some objects may have a scheduled sync (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data from both HubSpot and Salesforce. However, this may require a one-time manual import or a custom integration using Zapier or Make.
