# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with manual data entry and synchronization between these two critical tools. By automating the flow of data between HubSpot and Salesforce, teams can reduce the time spent on data management and focus on higher-value activities. 
- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Streamlining lead management and sales pipeline visibility.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts) and setting up field mappings.

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app (e.g., "New Contact in HubSpot")
3. Set Salesforce as the action app (e.g., "Create New Contact in Salesforce")
4. Map fields accordingly, ensuring that critical information such as email, phone number, and company name are correctly aligned between the two systems.

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New lead in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Automated lead syncing, ensuring sales teams have the latest information |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, such as updating contact information in both systems:
- Update contact in HubSpot > Triggers update in Salesforce
- Update account in Salesforce > Triggers update in HubSpot, ensuring data consistency across both platforms.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens, ensuring that permissions are correctly set.
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid hitting API rate limits.
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, ensuring all necessary fields are correctly mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce.

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for quick intervention and minimizing data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain advanced data types may not sync seamlessly.
- **Rate Limits:** Both HubSpot and Salesforce have API call limits that can affect sync frequency and data volume.
- **Feature Gaps:** Certain features, like advanced reporting, may not be fully supported in lower tiers of either platform.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the integration requires at least the Professional tier of HubSpot.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but can be scheduled for less frequent updates depending on the specific setup and requirements.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, it's possible to backfill historical data, but this may require additional setup and potentially manual intervention to ensure data integrity and consistency.
