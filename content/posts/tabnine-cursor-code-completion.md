## When to Choose Tabnine
* If you're a 10-person startup with limited budget and prefer a high degree of control over your code completion AI, Tabnine's local AI approach may be the better choice.
* If you're working on a project with sensitive data and prefer to keep your AI models on-premise, Tabnine's local AI is a better fit.
* If you're a solo developer or a small team with simple code completion needs, Tabnine's lower pricing tier may be more attractive.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing advanced code completion features without breaking the bank, Tabnine's per-user subscription model can save you up to $5,000 per year compared to Cursor.

## When to Choose Cursor
* If you're a 100-person enterprise with a large cloud infrastructure and need a highly scalable code completion solution, Cursor's cloud-based AI is a better choice.
* If you're working on a project with complex code completion requirements and need access to a large corpus of code data, Cursor's cloud-based AI may be more effective.
* If you're a team with limited IT resources and prefer a hassle-free, cloud-based code completion solution, Cursor's ease of integration and 24/7 support may be more appealing.
* For instance, if you're a 20-person development team working on a large-scale project with multiple repositories, Cursor's cloud-based AI can reduce your code completion time by up to 30% and improve your overall development efficiency.

## Real-World Use Case: Code Completion
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person development team needs to implement code completion for their JavaScript project. With Tabnine, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 hours, including installing the local AI model and configuring the IDE integration. Ongoing maintenance burden would be relatively low, with occasional updates to the AI model. The cost breakdown for 20 users would be around $300 per month. However, with Cursor, the setup complexity would be significantly lower, around 30 minutes, with a cloud-based AI model that requires minimal configuration. The ongoing maintenance burden would be virtually zero, with automatic updates to the AI model. The cost breakdown for 20 users would be around $400 per month. Common gotchas with Tabnine include the need for significant local machine resources to run the AI model, while with Cursor, the main gotcha is the potential for latency issues with cloud-based AI.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Tabnine and Cursor, data export/import limitations may apply, particularly with Tabnine's local AI model. Training time needed for the new AI model may be significant, around 1-2 weeks, depending on the complexity of the project. Hidden costs may include the need for additional cloud infrastructure or IT resources to support the new AI model. For example, if migrating from Tabnine to Cursor, you may need to pay for additional cloud storage to support the larger AI model, which could add up to $500 per month.

## FAQ
Q: Which tool offers better code completion accuracy?
A: Both Tabnine and Cursor offer advanced code completion features with high accuracy rates, around 90-95%. However, Cursor's cloud-based AI may have a slight edge in terms of accuracy due to its access to a larger corpus of code data.

Q: Can I use both Tabnine and Cursor together?
A: Yes, you can use both tools together, but it may require significant configuration and integration efforts. For example, you could use Tabnine for local code completion and Cursor for cloud-based code completion, but you would need to ensure that both tools are properly integrated with your IDE and project workflow.

Q: Which tool has better ROI for code completion?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, Tabnine's per-user subscription model can offer a better ROI for small to medium-sized teams, with a potential cost savings of up to $5,000 per year. However, for larger teams with extensive cloud infrastructure, Cursor's cloud-based AI may offer a better ROI due to its scalability and ease of integration, with a potential cost savings of up to $10,000 per year.

---
**Bottom Line:** For most development teams, Tabnine's local AI approach offers a better value proposition for code completion, but larger teams with cloud infrastructure may prefer Cursor's cloud-based AI for its scalability and ease of integration.
