# Does Mailchimp Have A/B Testing? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Mailchimp offers A/B testing, but it's primarily limited to subject lines and send times, allowing you to compare the performance of different subject lines or send times to determine which one resonates better with your audience. This means you can test variations of your email campaigns to optimize open rates and engagement, but the feature is not as comprehensive as some users might hope, lacking the ability to test other elements like email content or CTAs.

## How to Use A/B Testing in Mailchimp (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the "Campaigns" tab in your Mailchimp account and click on "Create Campaign" to start a new email campaign.
2. Click on the "A/B Testing" option in the campaign setup process, where you can choose to test either subject lines or send times.
3. Result: Mailchimp will automatically split your email list into segments to test the different versions of your subject line or send time, providing you with analytics on which version performed better, helping you refine your campaign for better engagement.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Mailchimp's native A/B testing is limited, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like Zapier to automate more complex testing scenarios, such as testing different email content based on user interactions.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Mailchimp's own "Multivariate Testing" plugin, which can offer more advanced testing capabilities, though these might require additional setup and cost.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create duplicate campaigns with slight variations and use Mailchimp's analytics to compare their performance, though this method is more time-consuming and less efficient than automated A/B testing.

## Better Alternatives for A/B Testing
If A/B Testing is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Campaign Optimization), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Klaviyo (Native support) offers advanced A/B testing capabilities, including testing for email content, CTAs, and more, making it a strong choice for e-commerce businesses.
- **Alternative 2:** Sendinblue (Better implementation) provides a more comprehensive A/B testing feature set, including the ability to test subject lines, send times, and email content, with detailed analytics to help optimize campaigns.

## FAQ
Q: Is A/B Testing coming in the roadmap?
