## Real-World Use Case: PaaS
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to deploy a web application with 100 users and 1000 actions per day. With Dokku, setup complexity would take around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown would be $0 (self-hosted), with potential costs for infrastructure and support. With Heroku, setup complexity would take around 1-2 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 0.5-1 hours per week. The cost breakdown would be $250-500 per month (depending on the tiered pricing), with potential costs for support and integrations. Common gotchas include Dokku's limited scalability and Heroku's potential costs for add-ons and integrations.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Dokku and Heroku, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Dokku's self-hosted model allows for full control over data, while Heroku's paid tiered pricing includes data export/import capabilities.
* Training time needed: Dokku requires DevOps expertise, while Heroku's user-friendly interface requires less training time.
* Hidden costs: Dokku's self-hosted model may incur infrastructure and support costs, while Heroku's paid tiered pricing includes potential costs for add-ons and integrations.
