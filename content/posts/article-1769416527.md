# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with manual data entry and synchronization between these two critical tools. By automating the flow of contact, lead, and customer data, teams can save a substantial amount of time and reduce errors. 
- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Automating lead qualification and handoff from marketing to sales, ensuring that all customer interactions are up-to-date and accessible across both platforms.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited edition)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration limitations are encountered, such as specific custom field mappings:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or a scenario in Make (formerly Integromat)
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, including any custom fields required for your workflow

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Qualification and Handoff
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New form submission in HubSpot | Create a new lead in Salesforce | Automatically qualified leads are assigned to sales reps |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, such as updating contact information in both systems:
- When a contact's email is updated in Salesforce, the change is reflected in HubSpot.
- Conversely, when a contact's information is updated in HubSpot (e.g., through a form submission), the update is synced back to Salesforce.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize the connection with fresh tokens, ensuring that the credentials used are correct and have not expired.
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce the sync frequency to every 15 minutes to comply with API rate limits and prevent temporary bans.
- **"Missing Fields":** Check the required field mapping to ensure all necessary fields are correctly mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce.

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when the sync breaks, allowing for prompt action to resolve the issue and minimize data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Certain custom data types in Salesforce may not sync with HubSpot due to compatibility issues.
- **Rate Limits:** Both HubSpot and Salesforce have API call limits that can temporarily restrict the frequency of data synchronization.
- **Feature Gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot and certain lower tiers of Salesforce may lack features necessary for full integration functionality, such as advanced workflow automation.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: Limited integration features are available on the free tier, but full functionality requires at least the Professional tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most actions, but some operations may be scheduled (e.g., every 15 minutes) due to API rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, backfilling of historical data is possible but may require manual configuration and could be subject to API rate limits, potentially taking several hours or days to complete, depending on the volume of data.
