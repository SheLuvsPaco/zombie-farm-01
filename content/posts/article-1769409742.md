# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This reduces manual data entry and ensures that both teams have access to the most up-to-date information. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Streamlining the sales process by automatically syncing lead status updates from HubSpot to Salesforce, enabling sales teams to focus on high-priority leads.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, including email, name, and company

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information is synced between both platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a deal is closed in Salesforce, the corresponding contact in HubSpot can be updated to reflect the new customer status.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, especially for custom fields

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by integrating HubSpot or Salesforce with Slack via Zapier.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain advanced Salesforce features may not sync.
- **Rate Limits:** Both HubSpot and Salesforce have API call limits that can affect sync frequency.
- **Feature Gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration, and some features may be limited in lower Salesforce tiers.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need at least the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most updates, but some actions may be scheduled to sync every 15 minutes due to API call limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, both native integration and Zapier/Make methods allow for backfilling historical data, but this may require additional setup and can be subject to API call limits.
