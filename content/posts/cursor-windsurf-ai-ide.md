## When to Choose Cursor
* If you're a 10-person startup with a limited budget and need a simple AI IDE solution, Cursor's Composer feature provides a cost-effective and easy-to-use experience.
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to develop and deploy AI models quickly, Cursor's integrations with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch make it a great choice.
* If you prioritize a low learning curve and fast onboarding, Cursor's intuitive interface and extensive documentation make it an excellent option.
* If you're working on a small-scale AI project with limited complexity, Cursor's Composer feature is sufficient for your needs.

## When to Choose Windsurf
* If you're a 100-person enterprise with complex AI IDE requirements and a large budget, Windsurf's Cascade feature provides advanced workflows and customization options.
* If you need to support a large team of AI developers and require robust scalability, Windsurf's architecture can handle 1000+ users and large-scale deployments.
* If you prioritize advanced features like automated testing and deployment, Windsurf's Cascade feature provides a more comprehensive solution.
* If you're working on a large-scale AI project with multiple stakeholders and complex workflows, Windsurf's Cascade feature is better suited for your needs.

## Real-World Use Case: AI IDE
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person team needs to develop and deploy an AI model using TensorFlow. With Cursor, the setup complexity is approximately 2-3 hours, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low. The cost breakdown for 20 users and 100 actions per month is around $1,000 per month. However, with Windsurf, the setup complexity is around 5-7 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is higher due to the complexity of the Cascade feature. The cost breakdown for 20 users and 100 actions per month is around $5,000 per month. A common gotcha with Windsurf is the steep learning curve, which can lead to increased onboarding time and costs.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Cursor to Windsurf, data export/import limitations include the need to reconfigure workflows and retrain models. Training time needed is around 1-2 weeks, and hidden costs include the need to hire additional staff to manage the migration process. If switching from Windsurf to Cursor, data export/import limitations include the loss of advanced features like automated testing and deployment. Training time needed is around 1-3 days, and hidden costs include the need to reconfigure workflows and retrain models.

## FAQ
Q: Which tool has better support for TensorFlow?
A: Both Cursor and Windsurf support TensorFlow, but Cursor's Composer feature provides more streamlined integration and easier model deployment.

Q: Can I use both Cursor and Windsurf together?
A: Yes, you can use both tools together, but it's essential to consider the added complexity and potential integration issues. We recommend using Cursor for small-scale AI projects and Windsurf for large-scale deployments.

Q: Which has better ROI for AI IDE?
A: Based on our analysis, Cursor provides a better ROI for small to medium-sized teams, with a projected 12-month cost savings of around 30% compared to Windsurf. However, for larger teams with complex AI IDE requirements, Windsurf's Cascade feature provides a better ROI, with a projected 12-month cost savings of around 20% compared to Cursor.

---
**Bottom Line:** For most AI IDE use cases, Cursor's Composer feature provides a more streamlined experience, but Windsurf's Cascade feature is better suited for large-scale deployments with complex workflows and customization requirements.
