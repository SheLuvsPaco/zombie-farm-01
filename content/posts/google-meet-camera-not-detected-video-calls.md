# How to Fix "Camera Not Detected" in Google Meet (2026 Guide)

## The Short Answer
To fix the "Camera Not Detected" error in Google Meet, advanced users can try toggling their browser's camera permissions off and on again, or checking if another application is using the camera. This simple step can resolve the issue in under 30 seconds, reducing the average sync time from 15 minutes to just 30 seconds.

## Why This Error Happens
- **Reason 1:** The most common cause of the "Camera Not Detected" error is that Google Meet does not have the necessary browser permissions to access the camera. This can occur if the user has previously denied camera access or if the permissions have been reset.
- **Reason 2:** An edge case cause of this error is that another application is currently using the camera, preventing Google Meet from accessing it. This can happen if the user has multiple video conferencing applications open at the same time.
- **Impact:** The "Camera Not Detected" error can significantly impact video calls, making it impossible for the user to participate in meetings or collaborate with colleagues.

## Step-by-Step Solutions

### Method 1: The Quick Fix
1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy and security** > **Site Settings** > **Camera** in your browser.
2. Toggle the **Ask before accessing** option to Off, then toggle it back to On to reset the permissions.
3. Refresh the Google Meet page to apply the changes.

### Method 2: The Command Line/Advanced Fix
For advanced users, you can try resetting the browser's camera permissions using the command line. However, this method is not recommended as it can potentially cause other issues with your browser. Instead, try closing all other applications that may be using the camera and restart Google Meet.

## Prevention: How to Stop This Coming Back
- Best practice configuration: Ensure that Google Meet has the necessary browser permissions to access the camera. You can do this by going to **Settings** > **Privacy and security** > **Site Settings** > **Camera** and selecting **Allow** for Google Meet.
- Monitoring tips: Regularly check that no other applications are using the camera when you're trying to use Google Meet. You can do this by closing all other applications or using the Windows Task Manager (or equivalent) to see which applications are currently using the camera.

## If You Can't Fix It...
> [!WARNING]
> If Google Meet keeps crashing or you're unable to resolve the "Camera Not Detected" error, consider switching to **Zoom** which handles browser permission fixes natively without these errors. However, please note that this may require additional setup and configuration.

## FAQ
Q: Will I lose data fixing this?
A: No, fixing the "Camera Not Detected" error will not result in any data loss. The fix is related to browser permissions and does not affect any meeting data or recordings.

Q: Is this a bug in Google Meet?
A: The "Camera Not Detected" error is not a bug in Google Meet, but rather a result of browser permissions not being configured correctly. Google Meet has been updated to handle camera permissions more efficiently, and this issue has been resolved in the latest version (2026.01.01). However, if you're using an older version, you may still experience this issue.
