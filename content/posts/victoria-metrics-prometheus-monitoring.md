## When to Choose Victoria Metrics
- If you're a 10-person startup with limited budget and simple monitoring needs, Victoria Metrics offers a cost-effective solution with a pay-per-metric pricing model.
- If you prioritize ease of use and don't require extensive customization, Victoria Metrics provides a more streamlined experience.
- If you're already invested in the Victoria Metrics ecosystem, it's likely more convenient to stick with their monitoring solution.
- For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to monitor a small set of critical metrics, Victoria Metrics can help you get started quickly and affordably.

## When to Choose Prometheus
- If you're a large enterprise with complex monitoring requirements, Prometheus offers high scalability and extensive integration capabilities.
- If you have a team with expertise in metrics collection and are comfortable with a steeper learning curve, Prometheus provides more advanced features.
- If you prioritize customization and flexibility, Prometheus's open-source nature and community-driven development make it a better fit.
- For instance, if you're a 500-person e-commerce company with a large-scale infrastructure, Prometheus can handle your monitoring needs and provide valuable insights.

## Real-World Use Case: Monitoring
Let's consider a scenario where we need to monitor a web application's performance, including metrics such as response time, error rate, and throughput. 
- Setup complexity: Victoria Metrics requires approximately 2 hours to set up, while Prometheus takes around 5 days to configure.
- Ongoing maintenance burden: Victoria Metrics requires minimal maintenance, while Prometheus demands regular updates and configuration adjustments.
- Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions: Victoria Metrics would cost around $50 per month, while Prometheus is free to use, but may require additional infrastructure costs.
- Common gotchas: With Victoria Metrics, be aware of the potential for metric overload, while with Prometheus, be cautious of the complexity of its query language.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between these tools:
- Data export/import limitations: Victoria Metrics allows for easy data export, while Prometheus requires more manual effort.
- Training time needed: Prometheus requires significant training time, especially for those without prior experience.
- Hidden costs: When migrating to Prometheus, consider the potential costs of additional infrastructure and personnel required for maintenance.
