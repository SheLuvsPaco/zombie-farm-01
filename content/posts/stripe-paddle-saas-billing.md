# Stripe vs Paddle: Which is Better for SaaS Billing?

## Quick Verdict
For most SaaS businesses, especially those with international customers, Paddle is the better choice due to its robust tax compliance automation features, which can save up to 10 hours of manual work per month. However, Stripe is more suitable for smaller teams or those already invested in the Stripe ecosystem, as it offers a more straightforward pricing model. Ultimately, the decision depends on the team size, budget, and specific billing needs.

## When to Choose Stripe
- If you're a small SaaS team (less than 10 people) with a simple billing setup, Stripe's straightforward pricing model and extensive integrations make it a great choice.
- If you're already using other Stripe products, such as Stripe Payments or Stripe Connect, it's more convenient to stick with Stripe for billing.
- If you have a low-volume, low-complexity billing setup, Stripe's per-transaction pricing might be more cost-effective.
- For example, if you're a 5-person SaaS company with a simple subscription-based model, Stripe might be the better choice, with a estimated monthly cost of $100-$300.

## When to Choose Paddle
- If you're a growing SaaS business (10-50 people) with international customers, Paddle's tax compliance automation features can save you significant time and resources.
- If you have a complex billing setup with multiple pricing plans, discounts, and promotions, Paddle's customizable billing engine can handle the complexity.
- If you need priority support and a dedicated account manager, Paddle's enterprise plans offer more comprehensive support.
- For instance, if you're a 20-person SaaS company with customers in the EU and US, Paddle's automated tax calculation and reporting can reduce your monthly compliance burden by up to 20 hours.

## Real-World Use Case: SaaS Billing
Let's consider a SaaS company with 100 customers, each with a monthly subscription plan. With Stripe, setting up the billing system would take around 2-3 days, with an estimated monthly cost of $500-$1,000. Ongoing maintenance would require around 5-10 hours per month. With Paddle, the setup process would take around 1-2 days, with an estimated monthly cost of $300-$600. Ongoing maintenance would require around 2-5 hours per month. However, Paddle's automated tax compliance features would save an additional 10 hours per month.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Stripe to Paddle, you'll need to export your customer data and import it into Paddle, which can take around 1-2 days. You'll also need to update your billing setup and configure Paddle's tax compliance features, which can take an additional 2-3 days. Training time for your team will depend on the complexity of your billing setup, but expect around 1-2 weeks. Hidden costs to consider include potential fees for custom integrations or priority support.

A: Based on a 12-month projection, Paddle's automated tax compliance features can save up to $10,000 per year in manual labor costs, while Stripe's per-transaction pricing might be more cost-effective for low-volume billing setups. However, Paddle's customizable billing engine and priority support can lead to increased revenue and customer satisfaction, resulting in a better overall ROI.
