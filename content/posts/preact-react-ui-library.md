# Preact vs React: Which is Better for UI Library?

## Quick Verdict
For small to medium-sized teams with limited budgets, Preact is a more suitable choice due to its significantly smaller bundle size, which reduces page load times and improves overall user experience. However, for larger teams with more complex UI requirements, React's extensive ecosystem and scalability features may outweigh the benefits of Preact's smaller size. Ultimately, the choice between Preact and React depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | Preact | React | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | Free, open-source | Free, open-source | Tie |
| Learning Curve | Gentle, similar to React | Steeper, due to larger ecosystem | Preact |
| Integrations | Limited, but growing | Extensive, with large ecosystem | React |
| Scalability | Suitable for small to medium-sized apps | Highly scalable, with large apps | React |
| Support | Community-driven, with limited resources | Extensive, with large community and official support | React |
| Bundle Size | ~3KB gzipped | ~33KB gzipped | Preact |
| Virtual DOM | Yes, with a smaller footprint | Yes, with a larger footprint | Preact |

## When to Choose Preact
- If you're a small team (less than 10 people) with a limited budget, Preact's smaller bundle size and gentler learning curve make it an attractive choice.
- If you're building a small to medium-sized application with simple UI requirements, Preact's lightweight nature and ease of use make it a good fit.
- If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to reduce page load times and improve user experience, Preact's smaller bundle size can help achieve this goal.
- If you're working on a project with strict size constraints, such as a mobile app or a web app for low-end devices, Preact's smaller size makes it a better choice.

## When to Choose React
- If you're a large team (more than 50 people) with complex UI requirements, React's extensive ecosystem and scalability features make it a better choice.
- If you're building a large, complex application with many integrations and third-party libraries, React's larger ecosystem and official support make it a more suitable choice.
- If you're a 100-person enterprise company needing to build a highly scalable and maintainable UI library, React's extensive features and large community make it a better fit.
- If you're working on a project that requires a high degree of customization and flexibility, React's larger ecosystem and more extensive feature set make it a better choice.

## Real-World Use Case: UI Library
Let's consider a real-world scenario where we need to build a UI library for a SaaS application. We'll compare how Preact and React handle this scenario:
- Setup complexity: Preact requires less setup time, with a simple `npm install` and a few lines of code to get started (approximately 1-2 hours). React, on the other hand, requires more setup time, with a larger number of dependencies and more complex configuration (approximately 2-5 days).
- Ongoing maintenance burden: Preact requires less maintenance effort, with a smaller codebase and fewer dependencies to manage (approximately 1-2 hours per week). React, on the other hand, requires more maintenance effort, with a larger codebase and more dependencies to manage (approximately 5-10 hours per week).
- Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions: Preact's smaller bundle size reduces page load times and improves user experience, resulting in cost savings of approximately $100-200 per month. React's larger bundle size increases page load times and reduces user experience, resulting in additional costs of approximately $500-1000 per month.
- Common gotchas: Preact's smaller size can make it more difficult to find third-party libraries and integrations, while React's larger size can make it more difficult to optimize and maintain.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Preact and React:
- Data export/import limitations: Preact's smaller size makes it easier to export and import data, with fewer dependencies to manage. React's larger size makes it more difficult to export and import data, with more dependencies to manage.
- Training time needed: Preact requires less training time, with a gentler learning curve and fewer features to learn (approximately 1-2 weeks). React requires more training time, with a steeper learning curve and more features to learn (approximately 2-6 weeks).
- Hidden costs: Preact's smaller size reduces the risk of hidden costs, with fewer dependencies to manage and less maintenance effort required. React's larger size increases the risk of hidden costs, with more dependencies to manage and more maintenance effort required.

## FAQ
Q: What is the main difference between Preact and React?
A: The main difference between Preact and React is the bundle size, with Preact being significantly smaller (approximately 3KB gzipped) and React being larger (approximately 33KB gzipped).

Q: Can I use both Preact and React together?
A: Yes, you can use both Preact and React together, but it's not recommended due to the potential for conflicts and increased complexity. Instead, choose one library and stick with it to avoid unnecessary complexity and maintenance effort.

Q: Which has better ROI for UI Library?
A: Preact has a better ROI for UI Library, with cost savings of approximately $100-200 per month due to its smaller bundle size and reduced page load times. React's larger bundle size increases costs by approximately $500-1000 per month, resulting in a lower ROI.

**Bottom Line:** For small to medium-sized teams with limited budgets and simple UI requirements, Preact is a better choice due to its smaller bundle size and gentler learning curve, while larger teams with complex UI requirements may prefer React's extensive ecosystem and scalability features.
