# How to Connect Trello to Google Calendar (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of Trello and Google Calendar solves the workflow problem of manually updating calendars with task deadlines and due dates. This integration automates the process, ensuring that team members and stakeholders have a unified view of project timelines. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Managing project deadlines and scheduling team meetings.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Trello account (any tier)
- [ ] Active Google Calendar account (any tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both Trello and Google Calendar

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In Trello, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Google Calendar
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as mapping Trello boards to Google Calendar events

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set Trello as trigger (e.g., "New Card Added")
3. Set Google Calendar as action (e.g., "Create New Event")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as card title to event title and due date to event date

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Trello to Google Calendar
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New card added to Trello board | Create new event in Google Calendar | Trello card title and due date are synced to Google Calendar event |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Google Calendar events can be synced back to Trello as new cards, allowing for bidirectional data flow. This enables teams to update project schedules from either platform.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that Trello card due dates are properly mapped to Google Calendar event dates

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers on Trello or Google Calendar errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- Trello's free tier has limited integration capabilities, such as restricted access to certain power-ups
- Google Calendar has rate limits on API requests, which can impact sync frequency
- Feature gaps between Trello and Google Calendar tiers may affect the level of integration, such as the ability to sync custom fields

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of Trello?
A: Yes, but with limited integration capabilities.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to avoid rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, but this may require manual configuration and backfilling of data, depending on the specific integration method used.
