With WorkOS, setup complexity would take around 3-5 days, with ongoing maintenance burden of around 2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users and 1,000 actions per month would be around $3,000 per month. With Clerk, setup complexity would take around 1-2 days, with ongoing maintenance burden of around 1 hour per week.
