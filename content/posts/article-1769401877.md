# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors. A common use case for this integration is to sync contact information and sales activity between HubSpot's marketing automation platform and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Syncing contact information and sales activity to ensure accurate and up-to-date records across both platforms.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, companies, deals) and setting the sync frequency (e.g., every 15 minutes)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger (e.g., "New Contact Created")
3. Set Salesforce as the action (e.g., "Create New Contact")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot's "Email" field to Salesforce's "Email" field

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information is synced between HubSpot and Salesforce |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a deal is closed in Salesforce, it can trigger an update in HubSpot to reflect the changed deal status.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 30 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure that all necessary fields are included in the sync

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers on errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- HubSpot's free tier does not support Salesforce integration
- Salesforce has rate limits on API calls, which can impact sync frequency
- The native integration does not support syncing custom objects

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at specific intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to reduce API calls.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced, but it may require a one-time backfill process to transfer existing data from one platform to the other.
