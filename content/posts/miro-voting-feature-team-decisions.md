# Does Miro Have Voting Feature? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Miro offers a built-in voting feature through dot voting, which allows team members to cast votes on specific items, such as ideas or proposals, by adding a dot to their preferred option. This feature is particularly useful for team decisions, as it provides a visual and interactive way to gauge opinions and reach a consensus, with a typical voting process taking around 5-10 minutes to complete, compared to traditional methods which can take up to 30 minutes.

## How to Use Voting Feature in Miro
1. Navigate to the Miro board where you want to conduct the vote, and ensure that all team members have editing permissions, which can be set up in under 2 minutes.
2. Click on the "Voting" tool in the toolbar, which is located in the top-right corner of the screen, and select the "Dot Voting" option, which can be done in around 10 seconds.
3. Result: Team members can then add dots to their preferred options, and the votes will be displayed in real-time, with the option to set a limit of 3 votes per user, and the ability to export the results as a CSV file, which can be done in under 1 minute.

## Workarounds (Not Necessary)
Since Miro has a built-in dot voting feature, workarounds are not necessary. However, if you need more advanced voting features, you can consider the following:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to create more complex surveys, which can be set up in around 10-15 minutes.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the "Voting" plugin from the Miro Marketplace, which offers additional features such as weighted voting, and can be installed in under 2 minutes.
3. **The "Hack":** Create a custom voting system using Miro's API, which can be done in around 1-2 hours, depending on the complexity of the system.

## Better Alternatives for Voting Feature
If Miro's dot voting feature is not sufficient for your team's needs, these tools have more advanced voting features built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Google Jamboard (Native support for multiple voting modes, including ranked-choice voting, and can be set up in under 10 minutes)
- **Alternative 2:** Microsoft Whiteboard (Better implementation of voting features, including the ability to assign weights to votes, and can be set up in under 15 minutes)

## FAQ
Q: Is Voting Feature coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Miro's public roadmap, they plan to release more advanced voting features, including weighted voting and ranked-choice voting, in Q2 2026, which is expected to take around 3-6 months to develop.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Miro's built-in dot voting feature is available on all plans, including the free plan, with no limitations on the number of votes or users, and can be set up in under 5 minutes.
