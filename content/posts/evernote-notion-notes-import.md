# How to Migrate from Evernote to Notion (Step-by-Step)

Migrating data from Evernote to Notion can be a complex process, but with a clear plan, you can ensure a safe and successful transfer of your valuable notes and data. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to migrate your data from Evernote to Notion, organizing your legacy notes into databases and taking advantage of Notion's powerful features.

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Backup Evernote data (Export as CSV/JSON): This step is crucial to prevent data loss. Evernote allows you to export your data in CSV or JSON format. To do this, go to Settings > Data Management > Export, and choose the format that suits your needs.
- [ ] Create Notion account (Trial/Paid): Sign up for a Notion account, either trial or paid, depending on your requirements. This will give you access to Notion's features and allow you to import your data.
- [ ] Map your fields (e.g., "Deal Name" in Evernote = "Opportunity" in Notion): Take some time to map your fields from Evernote to Notion. This will ensure that your data is organized correctly and that you can take full advantage of Notion's database features. For example, if you have a field called "Deal Name" in Evernote, you may want to map it to a field called "Opportunity" in Notion.
- [ ] Inform your team of downtime: If you're migrating a large amount of data, it's essential to inform your team of the expected downtime. This will help prevent any disruptions to your work and ensure a smooth transition.

## Method 1: The "One-Click" Importer (If available)
Notion occasionally offers a native import tool for Evernote users. To check if this feature is available, follow these steps:
- Log in to your Notion account and go to Settings > Import.
- Look for the "Evernote" option and click on it.
- If the feature is available, follow the prompts to import your data.
However, as of our knowledge cutoff, this feature is not always available, and we recommend using Method 2 for a more reliable migration process.

## Method 2: Manual CSV Export/Import (The Reliable Way)
1. **Export from Evernote:** Go to Settings > Data Management > Export, and choose the CSV format. This will export all your notes and data from Evernote.
2. **Clean the Data:** Open the exported CSV file in Excel or a similar spreadsheet program and remove any empty rows. This will help prevent any errors during the import process.
3. **Import to Notion:** Go to Settings > Import > CSV in your Notion account, and select the cleaned CSV file. Notion will guide you through the import process, allowing you to map your fields and create a new database.
4. **Map Fields:** Ensure that your columns match perfectly between the CSV file and your Notion database. This will prevent any data loss or corruption during the import process.

## Critical: What DOESN'T Transfer?
When migrating from Evernote to Notion, some data may not transfer automatically, including:
- File attachments: These will need to be manually uploaded to Notion or transferred via API.
- Activity logs: These are not transferred during the migration process and will need to be manually recreated in Notion.
- Notes with complex formatting: These may not transfer perfectly and may require manual reformatting in Notion.

To move these manually or via API, you can use Notion's API to upload file attachments and create activity logs. However, this requires some technical expertise and may not be feasible for all users.

## Post-Migration Testing
After completing the migration, it's essential to verify that your data has been transferred correctly:
- Verify record counts: Check that the number of records in your Notion database matches the number of records in your Evernote account. For example, if you had 500 leads in Evernote, you should have 500 leads in Notion.
- Check standard and custom fields: Ensure that all your fields, including standard and custom fields, have been transferred correctly and are functioning as expected.

## FAQ
Q: How long does this take?
A: The migration time depends on the amount of data being transferred. For 1,000 records, the process typically takes around 10-15 minutes. For 10,000 records, the process can take around 1-2 hours. However, this time may vary depending on the complexity of your data and the speed of your internet connection.

Q: Will I lose my SEO/History?
A: When migrating from Evernote to Notion, you may lose some of your SEO history, as Notion uses a different system for tracking page views and engagement. However, you can use Notion's API to transfer some of this data, such as page views and comments. Additionally, you can use Notion's built-in analytics tools to track engagement and page views going forward.

By following these steps and considering the potential limitations, you can ensure a successful migration from Evernote to Notion, organizing your legacy notes into databases and taking advantage of Notion's powerful features.
