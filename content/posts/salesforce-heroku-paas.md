# Salesforce vs Heroku: Which is Better for PaaS?

## Quick Verdict
For small to medium-sized teams with limited budget and straightforward PaaS needs, Heroku is a more cost-effective and agile choice. However, for larger enterprises with complex integrations and a strong existing Salesforce ecosystem, Salesforce's PaaS capabilities might be more suitable. Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific use case, team size, and budget.

## When to Choose Salesforce
- If you're a 500-person enterprise with a large existing Salesforce implementation and need to integrate PaaS capabilities with your CRM, Salesforce might be a better choice due to its native integration and scalability.
- If your team has extensive experience with Salesforce and can leverage its ecosystem, you may prefer Salesforce for PaaS to minimize learning curve and maximize integration benefits.
- For complex, large-scale PaaS projects requiring significant customization and support, Salesforce's premium support and extensive resources might be more suitable.
- If you're a 200-person company with a budget of $100,000/month for PaaS, Salesforce's custom pricing might be more cost-effective in the long run.

## When to Choose Heroku
- If you're a 10-person startup with a limited budget of $5,000/month for PaaS, Heroku's free plan and flexible pricing might be more appealing.
- For small to medium-sized teams with simple PaaS needs and limited resources, Heroku's user-friendly interface and moderate learning curve make it a more accessible choice.
- If your team is already familiar with Heroku's ecosystem and has experience with its add-ons, you may prefer Heroku for PaaS to minimize integration complexity and maximize development speed.
- For a 50-person SaaS company needing to quickly deploy and scale a PaaS solution, Heroku's agility and scalability features might be more suitable.

## Real-World Use Case: PaaS
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 100-person company needs to deploy a PaaS solution for a custom application. 
- Setup complexity: Heroku requires approximately 2-3 days for setup, while Salesforce needs around 5-7 days due to its more complex configuration.
- Ongoing maintenance burden: Heroku's automated scaling and add-ons reduce maintenance time to around 2 hours/week, whereas Salesforce requires more manual configuration and maintenance, taking around 5 hours/week.
- Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions: Heroku's pricing would be around $2,500/month (100 dynos \* $25/dyno), while Salesforce's custom pricing would depend on the specific implementation, but could range from $5,000 to $10,000/month.
- Common gotchas: Heroku's free plan has limitations on dyno hours, while Salesforce's custom pricing can lead to unexpected costs if not properly planned.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between these tools:
- Data export/import limitations: Heroku's data export is relatively straightforward, while Salesforce's data import/export requires more configuration and may incur additional costs.
- Training time needed: Heroku requires around 1-2 weeks of training for developers, whereas Salesforce needs around 2-3 months due to its steeper learning curve.
- Hidden costs: Salesforce's custom pricing and add-ons can lead to unexpected costs, while Heroku's pricing is more transparent, but may require additional costs for add-ons and support.
