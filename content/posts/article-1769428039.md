# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with manual data entry and synchronization between these two critical systems. By automating the flow of lead, contact, and customer data, teams can save a significant amount of time and reduce errors. 
- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Streamlining lead management and sales pipeline visibility.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited edition)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, including email, phone number, and company name

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information synced between both systems |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a deal is closed, updating the contact's status in HubSpot.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, especially for custom fields

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for quick intervention.

## Limitations to Know
- Custom object syncing is not supported in the native integration
- Salesforce API limits apply, restricting the number of requests per day
- The free tier of HubSpot does not support this integration

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the integration requires at least the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some actions may be scheduled to sync every 15 minutes.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, backfilling of historical data is possible but may require manual configuration and can be subject to API limits.
