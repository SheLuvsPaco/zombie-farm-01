## Real-World Use Case: Collaboration
Let's consider a 20-person marketing team collaborating on a social media campaign. With Figma, setup takes around 2 hours, and ongoing maintenance is relatively low, with a cost of $240/month for 20 users. However, with Miro, setup takes around 1 hour, and maintenance is also low, with a cost of $160/month for 20 users. While Figma excels at design-centric collaboration, Miro's whiteboard features and video conferencing capabilities make it better suited for brainstorming and virtual meetings. Common gotchas include Figma's steeper learning curve and Miro's limited design features.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Figma to Miro, data export/import limitations include Figma's limited CSV export options, while Miro offers more comprehensive import tools.
