# Substack Pricing 2026: The True Cost Explained

As a B2B procurement consultant, I've analyzed Substack's pricing tiers to provide a detailed breakdown of the costs and hidden factors that may impact your revenue. Substack is a popular platform for creators to publish and monetize their content, but it's essential to understand the true cost of using the platform.

## The Official Tiers (Simplified)
| Plan | Price | Key Limit | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | $0 | 100 subscribers, basic features | Testing, small audiences |
| Starter | $25/month | 1,000 subscribers, basic features | Solopreneurs, small businesses |
| Pro | $75/month | 10,000 subscribers, advanced features | Scaling teams, large businesses |

## The "Hidden" Costs They Don't Mention
- **Seat Costs:** Substack charges per publication, not per user. This means that if you have multiple publications, you'll need to pay for each one separately.
- **Add-ons:** Substack offers additional features like API access and SSO (Single Sign-On) for an extra fee. These add-ons can range from $10 to $50 per month, depending on the feature.
- **Overage Fees:** If you exceed the subscriber limit on your plan, Substack charges a 10% fee on all revenue earned above the limit. This can be a significant cost, especially if you're experiencing rapid growth. In contrast, some platform growth tools offer more flexible pricing models that can help you scale without breaking the bank.

## Comparison: Is it Worth It?
- **vs Competitor A (Ghost):** Ghost offers a similar platform for creators, with pricing starting at $9/month. However, Ghost's features are more limited, and it may not be suitable for larger businesses.
- **vs Competitor B (Memberful):** Memberful offers a more comprehensive platform with features like membership management and API access. Pricing starts at $25/month, but Memberful also charges a 10% transaction fee on all revenue earned.

## Strategic Recommendation
- **Buy the Pro plan if:** You need advanced features like API access, SSO, or custom branding. The Pro plan offers more flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for larger businesses.
- **Stay on Free if:** You have less than 100 subscribers and don't need advanced features. The Free plan is a great option for testing and small audiences.
- **Negotiation Tip:** If you're an enterprise customer, you can negotiate a custom plan with Substack. Be sure to ask about discounts for large volumes of subscribers or long-term commitments.

## FAQ
Q: Is there a startup discount?
A: Yes, Substack offers a 50% discount for the first 6 months for startups with less than $1 million in revenue.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
A: Yes, Substack offers a month-to-month contract, and you can cancel at any time. However, if you cancel during a billing cycle, you won't receive a refund for that cycle.

In conclusion, Substack's pricing tiers offer a range of options for creators, from small audiences to large businesses. However, it's essential to consider the hidden costs, such as seat costs, add-ons, and overage fees, to ensure you're getting the best value for your money. By understanding the true cost of using Substack, you can make an informed decision about which plan is right for you and negotiate a better deal if needed.
