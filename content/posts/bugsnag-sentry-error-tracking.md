## Real-World Use Case: Error Tracking
Let's say you're a 20-person team building a mobile app, and you want to track errors to improve user experience. With Bugsnag, setup takes around 2 hours, and ongoing maintenance is relatively low (less than 1 hour/week). The cost for 100 users/actions is around $100/month. However, with Sentry, setup takes around 5 hours, and ongoing maintenance is moderate (around 2 hours/week). The cost for 100 users/actions is around $150/month. Common gotchas with both tools include setting up incorrect filters or not configuring user feedback properly.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Bugsnag and Sentry, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Both tools have APIs for data export, but Sentry's data import process can be more complex.
* Training time needed: Sentry requires more training time due to its steeper learning curve (around 3-7 days).
* Hidden costs: Sentry's pricing model can lead to unexpected costs if you exceed the user limit or have a high volume of events.
