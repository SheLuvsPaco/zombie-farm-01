# Does Discord Have Read Receipts? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Discord does not have traditional read receipts like some other messaging platforms, but it does display a "read" status when a user views a message, indicated by the user's avatar appearing next to the message. However, this feature is limited to direct messages and group chats with fewer than 10 participants, and it does not provide a timestamp or explicit "read" indicator.

## How to Use Read Receipts in Discord (If Yes)
Since Discord's read status is not a traditional read receipt feature, there is no specific setup or configuration required to use it. However, here's how you can observe the read status:
1. Navigate to a direct message or group chat with fewer than 10 participants.
2. Send a message to the chat.
3. Observe the user avatars that appear next to the message as other users view it.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Discord doesn't support traditional read receipts natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like Zapier or IFTTT to create custom workflows that can simulate read receipts.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like BetterDiscord, which offers some custom features, including enhanced message tracking.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually ask the recipient to confirm they've read the message by responding with a specific phrase or emoji, such as "👍" or "Read".

## Better Alternatives for Read Receipts
If Read Receipts is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Message Seen), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Slack (Native support, with detailed read receipts and timestamps)
- **Alternative 2:** Microsoft Teams (Better implementation, with read receipts and delivery reports)

## FAQ
Q: Is Read Receipts coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Discord's public roadmap, there are no plans to introduce traditional read receipts, but the company is exploring ways to enhance message tracking and delivery reports.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, the limited read status feature in Discord is available to all users, regardless of their plan or subscription tier. However, some third-party plugins or integrations may require a paid subscription or have limitations on their free plans.
