## Real-World Use Case: Email Service

With Amazon SES, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, requiring AWS expertise. Ongoing maintenance would be relatively low, with a cost breakdown of $4.50 per day (10,000 emails \* $0.00045 per email). Common gotchas include handling bounce and complaint rates, which require additional setup and monitoring. With SendGrid, the setup complexity would be around 1-2 days, with a more user-friendly interface. Ongoing maintenance would be relatively low, with a cost breakdown of $29.95 per month (first 40,000 emails free, then $0.00045 per email). Common gotchas include managing email validation and authentication.
