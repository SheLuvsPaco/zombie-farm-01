| Learning Curve | Steep, requires extensive JavaScript knowledge | Moderate, supports JavaScript and other languages | @edge (for non-experts) |
| Integrations | Supports over 20 integrations, including AWS and Google Cloud | Supports 10+ integrations, including AWS and Azure | Fastly Compute (for large enterprises) |
| Scalability | Highly scalable, supports over 100,000 requests per second | Scalable, supports up to 10,000 requests per second | Fastly Compute (for high-traffic applications) |
| Support | 24/7 priority support for enterprise customers | Community support, with paid support options | Fastly Compute (for mission-critical applications) |
| Edge Computing Features | Supports serverless functions, edge-side includes, and A/B testing | Supports edge-side includes, A/B testing, and real-time analytics | Fastly Compute (for advanced edge computing) |

## When to Choose Fastly Compute
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to handle over 100,000 requests per second, Fastly Compute's scalability and advanced edge computing features make it the better choice.
* For teams with extensive JavaScript expertise, Fastly Compute's customizability and support for serverless functions are major advantages.
* If your application requires complex A/B testing and real-time analytics, Fastly Compute's edge computing features provide more flexibility and control.
* For large enterprises with a budget over $50,000 per month, Fastly Compute's custom quotes and priority support ensure a high level of service and reliability.

## When to Choose @edge
* If you're a 10-person startup with limited JavaScript expertise, @edge's more accessible pricing and moderate learning curve make it a better fit.
* For teams with smaller budgets (under $5,000 per month), @edge's tiered pricing and cost-effective solution are more attractive.
* If your application requires simple edge-side includes and A/B testing, @edge's features are sufficient and easier to implement.
* For small to medium-sized teams with limited edge computing requirements, @edge's community support and paid support options provide adequate assistance.

## Real-World Use Case: Edge Computing
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person e-commerce company needs to handle 10,000 requests per second and requires edge-side includes and A/B testing. 
* Setup complexity: Fastly Compute requires 2-3 days of setup, while @edge can be set up in 1-2 days.
* Ongoing maintenance burden: Fastly Compute requires more maintenance due to its customizability and complexity, while @edge is relatively low-maintenance.
* Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions: Fastly Compute would cost around $550 per month (based on $0.0055 per request), while @edge would cost around $100 per month (based on $0.01 per request).
* Common gotchas: With Fastly Compute, the steep learning curve and customizability can lead to errors and increased maintenance. With @edge, the limited scalability and lack of advanced edge computing features may become bottlenecks as the application grows.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between these tools:
* Data export/import limitations: Fastly Compute has more restrictive data export policies, while @edge allows for easier data migration.
* Training time needed: Fastly Compute requires more extensive training due to its complexity and customizability, while @edge requires moderate training.
* Hidden costs: Fastly Compute may have additional costs for custom support and priority features, while @edge has more transparent pricing.

## FAQ
Q: Which tool is better for real-time analytics?
A: Fastly Compute offers more advanced real-time analytics features, including support for serverless functions and edge-side includes.

Q: Can I use both Fastly Compute and @edge together?
A: Yes, you can use both tools together, but it may require custom integration and additional maintenance. It's essential to evaluate the benefits and costs of using both tools before deciding.

Q: Which has better ROI for Edge Computing?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, @edge offers a better ROI for small to medium-sized teams with limited edge computing requirements, while Fastly Compute provides a better ROI for large enterprises with complex edge computing needs and high traffic volumes.
