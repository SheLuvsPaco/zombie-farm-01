## Real-World Use Case: Documentation
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to create and maintain a comprehensive documentation portal for their customers. With Coda, the setup complexity is around 2-3 days, and the ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low due to automated workflows. The cost breakdown for 100 users is around $3,000 per year. However, with Notion, the setup complexity is around 1-2 days, and the ongoing maintenance burden is higher due to manual workflows. The cost breakdown for 100 users is around $1,000 per year. Common gotchas with Notion include the limited automation capabilities and the need for manual formatting.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Coda and Notion, data export/import limitations are a significant consideration. Coda provides a more comprehensive export feature, allowing for easy migration of documentation data. However, Notion's import feature is more limited, requiring manual formatting and setup. Training time needed for migration is around 1-2 weeks, and hidden costs include the potential need for custom integration development.
