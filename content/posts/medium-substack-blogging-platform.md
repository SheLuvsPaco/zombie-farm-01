* If you prioritize a user-friendly interface and don't mind a 50/50 revenue split, Medium is a suitable choice.

* If you're on a tight budget (less than $100/month) and want to focus on writing, Medium's free plan is a good option.

## When to Choose Substack
* If you're a established blogger or writer looking to monetize your existing audience, Substack's customizable subscription tiers and direct payment processing make it the better choice.
* If you prioritize content ownership and want to maintain full control over your work, Substack is the way to go.
