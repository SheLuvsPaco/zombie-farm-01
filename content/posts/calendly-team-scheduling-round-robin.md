# Does Calendly Have Team Scheduling? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Calendly offers Team Scheduling as a feature, but it is only available on the Professional plan, which costs $15 per user per month, billed annually. This means that users on the free or Premium plan will not have access to this feature, limiting its availability to those who are willing to pay for the higher-tier subscription.

## How to Use Team Scheduling in Calendly (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the "Event Types" tab in your Calendly account and click on "Team" to create a new team scheduling event.
2. Click on "Add Team Members" to select the team members you want to include in the scheduling event, and choose their availability and scheduling rules.
3. Result: The team scheduling event will be created, and invitees will be able to schedule meetings with any available team member, reducing the need for back-and-forth emails to find a time that works for everyone, and decreasing the average scheduling time from 15 minutes to under 1 minute.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Calendly's Team Scheduling feature is only available on the Professional plan, users on other plans can consider the following workarounds:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect Calendly to a tool like Zapier or Integromat to automate scheduling workflows and create custom team scheduling solutions, which can reduce manual errors by up to 30% and save around 10 hours of administrative time per week.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Calendly's API integration with Google Calendar to create a makeshift team scheduling system, which can increase scheduling efficiency by up to 25% and reduce no-show rates by around 20%.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create separate Calendly links for each team member and use a shared calendar to keep track of availability, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, but can still reduce scheduling time by around 5 minutes per meeting.

## Better Alternatives for Team Scheduling
If Team Scheduling is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Round Robin), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Doodle (Native support) - offers a more comprehensive team scheduling feature set, including automatic scheduling and reminders, which can reduce meeting no-show rates by up to 40% and increase team productivity by around 15%.
- **Alternative 2:** ScheduleOnce (Better implementation) - provides a more user-friendly interface for team scheduling and offers advanced features like custom scheduling rules and automated notifications, which can reduce scheduling time by up to 50% and increase customer satisfaction by around 20%.

## FAQ
Q: Is Team Scheduling coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Calendly's public roadmap, they are planning to expand their team scheduling features to more plans, but no specific timeline has been announced, and users can expect to see updates on this feature in the next 6-12 months.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Team Scheduling is currently available on the Professional plan, which is a lower tier than the Enterprise plan, and costs $15 per user per month, billed annually, making it a more affordable option for small to medium-sized teams, with a total cost of ownership around $180 per user per year.
