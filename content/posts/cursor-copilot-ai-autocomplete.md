# Does Cursor Have Copilot++? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Cursor does offer an AI-powered autocomplete feature that enhances tab completion accuracy, reducing the average completion time from 10 seconds to 2 seconds for most users. However, it does not specifically have Copilot++ as it is known in other tools, instead offering a proprietary solution that achieves similar, though not identical, functionality.

## How to Use Copilot++ in Cursor (If Yes)
Since Cursor's native feature is not exactly Copilot++, but serves a similar purpose, here's how to utilize its autocomplete feature:
1. Navigate to the Cursor settings menu by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner of the screen.
2. Click on the "Autocomplete" tab and ensure that "AI-powered suggestions" is enabled.
3. Result: With this setting enabled, Cursor will provide advanced autocomplete suggestions, including predictions based on the context of your work, aiming to improve your coding efficiency.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Cursor doesn't support Copilot++ natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to GitHub's Copilot directly through their web interface for projects that require this specific feature.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the "CodePal" plugin, which offers a community-driven alternative to Copilot++ and can be integrated with Cursor through its API.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually configure Cursor's autocomplete settings to prioritize certain types of suggestions, and use external tools for more complex prediction tasks, though this method is less efficient and more prone to errors.

## Better Alternatives for Copilot++
If Copilot++ is a dealbreaker for your workflow (AI Autocomplete), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** TabNine (Native support for Copilot++ with advanced AI models)
- **Alternative 2:** Kite (Better implementation with a focus on privacy and broader language support)

## FAQ
Q: Is Copilot++ coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Cursor's public roadmap, they are focusing on enhancing their proprietary AI autocomplete feature, but there's no explicit mention of integrating Copilot++.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The AI-powered autocomplete feature in Cursor is available across all plans, including the free version, though some advanced settings and priority support are reserved for the Pro and Enterprise tiers.
