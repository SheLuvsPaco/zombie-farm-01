## When to Choose Cursor
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing advanced AI coding assistant features, such as code review and debugging, and have a budget of over $10,000 per year.
* If your team requires seamless integration with a wide range of IDEs and code editors, and you prioritize a shorter learning curve.
* If you have a large team (over 100 users) and need a scalable solution with 24/7 priority support.
* If you prioritize a more comprehensive set of AI coding assistant features, such as advanced code completion and code refactoring.

## When to Choose Continue
* If you're a small team (less than 10 users) or have a limited budget (under $5,000 per year), and still want to leverage AI coding assistant capabilities.
* If you prioritize open-source customization and have the resources to invest in developing custom extensions.
* If you're a startup or a solo developer looking for a free, community-driven solution with optional paid support.
* If you need a high degree of control over your AI coding assistant setup and are willing to invest time in customization.

## Real-World Use Case: AI Coding Assistant
Let's consider a scenario where a 20-person development team needs to implement an AI coding assistant to improve code quality and reduce development time. With Cursor, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 hours, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $15,000 per year. In contrast, Continue would require around 5-7 days of setup, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 2-3 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $5,000 per year (with optional paid support). Common gotchas include the need for custom integration with existing IDEs and code editors, as well as potential issues with scalability.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Cursor and Continue, be aware of the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Cursor has a more comprehensive data export feature, while Continue requires manual data migration.
* Training time needed: Continue requires more time to set up and customize, while Cursor has a more streamlined onboarding process.
* Hidden costs: Cursor has a custom quote-based pricing model, which may include additional costs for support and maintenance. Continue has optional paid support, which may add to the overall cost.
