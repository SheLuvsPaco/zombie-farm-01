# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact and company data between HubSpot's marketing platform and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited edition)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, companies, deals)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or Make
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app (e.g., "New Contact in HubSpot")
3. Set Salesforce as the action app (e.g., "Create Contact in Salesforce")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot's "Email" field to Salesforce's "Email" field

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact data is synced between HubSpot and Salesforce |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, you can set up a reverse sync to update HubSpot contacts when changes are made in Salesforce. This ensures that both systems have the most up-to-date information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by reconnecting your Salesforce account in HubSpot's integration settings
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid hitting Salesforce's API limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping to ensure that all necessary fields are being synced between HubSpot and Salesforce

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing you to quickly investigate and resolve issues.

## Limitations to Know
- HubSpot's free tier does not support Salesforce integration
- Salesforce has API limits on the number of requests per day, which can impact sync frequency
- Some custom fields in Salesforce may not be supported by the native HubSpot integration

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need at least a Marketing Hub or Sales Hub subscription.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some objects may be synced on a scheduled basis (e.g., every 15 minutes) due to API limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data from HubSpot to Salesforce, but this may require a one-time data import or a custom integration setup.
