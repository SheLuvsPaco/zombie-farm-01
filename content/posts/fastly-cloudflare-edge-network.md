Ultimately, the decision depends on your specific use case and the level of control you need over your edge network.

- For teams with complex security requirements, such as financial institutions or e-commerce platforms, Fastly's customizable WAF and DDoS protection are more suitable.

- For example, a 100-person enterprise company with a large e-commerce platform might choose Fastly for its advanced security features and customizable edge logic.

## When to Choose Cloudflare
- If you're a 10-person startup with a limited budget (under $1,000 per month), Cloudflare's tiered pricing model and free plan make it a more affordable option.
- For teams prioritizing ease of use and a user-friendly interface, Cloudflare's moderate learning curve and built-in edge functions are more suitable.
- If you have a small to medium-sized team (under 50 people) with straightforward edge network requirements, Cloudflare's automated scaling and built-in security features provide a more streamlined experience.
- For instance, a 20-person marketing agency with a simple website might choose Cloudflare for its ease of use and affordable pricing.

## Real-World Use Case: Edge Network
Let's consider a scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to set up an edge network for its web application. With Fastly, the setup complexity would require around 2-3 days of technical expertise, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $5,000 per month. In contrast, Cloudflare would require around 1-2 days of setup time, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 30 minutes per week, and a cost breakdown of around $2,000 per month. However, Cloudflare's built-in edge functions might not provide the same level of customization as Fastly's edge logic.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Fastly and Cloudflare, consider the following:
- Data export/import limitations: Both platforms provide APIs for data export, but Cloudflare's data import process can be more complex.
- Training time needed: Fastly requires around 2-3 weeks of training for technical teams, while Cloudflare requires around 1-2 weeks.
- Hidden costs: Fastly's custom pricing model can lead to unexpected costs if not properly planned, while Cloudflare's tiered pricing model can result in overage charges if not monitored.
