## Real-World Use Case: Monorepo Tool
Let's say you're a 50-person SaaS company with a monorepo containing 20 packages, and you need to set up a new monorepo tool. With Lerna, the setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of around 1-2 hours per week. The cost would be $0, since Lerna is free. With Turborepo, the setup complexity would be around 5-7 days, with an ongoing maintenance burden of around 2-3 hours per week.
