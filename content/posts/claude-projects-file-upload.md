# Does Claude Have Projects? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Claude does have a concept of projects, but it is primarily designed for organizing and managing artifacts within a specific context, rather than traditional project management. This means that while Claude provides a way to group related artifacts together, it may not offer the full range of features typically associated with project management tools.

## How to Use Projects in Claude (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the "Artifacts" section in Claude, where you can create and manage different collections of artifacts.
2. Click on the "New Artifact Collection" button to create a new project, and then add relevant artifacts to it.
3. Result: You can then use the artifact collection as a way to organize and manage related files and data, although it may not have all the features you would expect from a traditional project management tool.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Claude's project features are limited to artifact management, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to tools like Asana or Trello to manage your projects, and then use Claude for artifact management within the context of those projects.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Zapier to automate workflows between Claude and other project management tools.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a naming convention for your artifacts that includes a project identifier, and then use Claude's filtering and sorting features to manage them.

## Better Alternatives for Projects
If Projects is a dealbreaker for your workflow (File Upload), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Notion (Native support for project management, including tasks, calendars, and team collaboration)
- **Alternative 2:** Airtable (Better implementation of project management features, including customizable tables, forms, and views)

## FAQ
Q: Is Projects coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Claude's public roadmap, there are plans to enhance the artifact management features, but there is no specific mention of adding full-fledged project management capabilities.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: The current artifact management features in Claude are available on all plans, including the free tier, although some advanced features may require a paid subscription.
