# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with manual data entry and synchronization between these two critical systems. By automating the flow of data between HubSpot and Salesforce, teams can reduce the time spent on data management and focus on higher-value activities. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Syncing contact information, lead status, and sales activity between HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure that both systems have the most up-to-date information.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited edition)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts) and setting the sync frequency (e.g., every 15 minutes)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger (e.g., "New Contact Created")
3. Set Salesforce as the action (e.g., "Create New Contact")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot's "Email" field to Salesforce's "Email" field

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New lead created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead information is synced between HubSpot and Salesforce |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a sales representative updates a lead's status in Salesforce, the corresponding contact in HubSpot can be updated automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 30 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure that all necessary fields are included in the sync

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers on errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data types:** Only standard data types (e.g., text, date, number) are supported for syncing. Custom data types may not be compatible.
- **Rate limits:** Salesforce has a limit of 1,000 API calls per day for Enterprise edition. Exceeding this limit can result in errors.
- **Feature gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. Only Marketing Hub or Sales Hub accounts can integrate with Salesforce.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need to have a Marketing Hub or Sales Hub account.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but you can also schedule syncs to occur at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data between HubSpot and Salesforce. However, this may require manual configuration and mapping of fields.
