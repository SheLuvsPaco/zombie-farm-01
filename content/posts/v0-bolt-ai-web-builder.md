## When to Choose v0
* If you're a 10-person startup with a limited budget and simple AI web builder needs, v0's flat fee and ease of use make it a more attractive option.
* If you prioritize a quick setup and don't require advanced features, v0 can get you up and running in under a week.
* If you're a small team with basic integration needs, v0's pre-built integrations may be sufficient.
* For example, if you're a 20-person marketing agency needing a simple AI web builder for client projects, v0's cost-effectiveness and ease of use make it a good fit.

## When to Choose Bolt
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company with complex AI web builder requirements, Bolt's advanced features and scalability make it a better choice.
* If you require a high degree of customization and flexibility in your AI web builder, Bolt's unlimited component generation and extensive integration options provide more flexibility.
* If you're a large team with multiple stakeholders and require 24/7 support, Bolt's premium support options provide added peace of mind.
* For instance, if you're a 100-person enterprise with multiple AI web builder projects, Bolt's scalability and support features make it a more suitable option.

## Real-World Use Case: AI Web Builder
Let's consider a scenario where we need to build an AI-powered web application for a client. With v0, setup complexity is around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low. However, the cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $10,000 per year. In contrast, Bolt requires a more complex setup (around 5-7 days) but offers more advanced features and scalability. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be around $15,000 per year. Common gotchas with v0 include limited component generation and integration options, while Bolt's complexity can be overwhelming for small teams.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from v0 to Bolt, data export/import limitations include a maximum of 100MB file size, and training time needed is around 2-3 weeks. Hidden costs include potential additional fees for custom integration development. When switching from Bolt to v0, data export/import limitations include a maximum of 50MB file size, and training time needed is around 1-2 weeks. Hidden costs include potential loss of advanced features and scalability.
