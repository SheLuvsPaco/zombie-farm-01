# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with manual data entry and synchronization between the two platforms. This integration automates the process, reducing the time spent on data entry and minimizing errors. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Sales teams can focus on high-value activities like closing deals, while marketing teams can optimize their campaigns with accurate and up-to-date data.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited edition)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as mapping contact and company fields

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, such as email and phone number

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Contact Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new contact in Salesforce | Contact information is synced between both platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce contacts can also trigger updates in HubSpot, ensuring a bidirectional data flow. For example, when a contact's status is updated in Salesforce, the corresponding contact in HubSpot will also be updated.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the email field is mapped correctly

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This allows you to quickly identify and resolve issues, minimizing downtime and data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data types:** Only standard contact and company fields are synced; custom fields may require additional setup.
- **Rate limits:** Salesforce has a limit of 1,000 API calls per day; excessive usage may result in rate limiting.
- **Feature gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration; a paid tier is required.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration; a paid tier (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub) is required.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, with updates reflected in both platforms within minutes.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced, but this may require additional setup and may be subject to rate limits. It's recommended to backfill data in batches to avoid exceeding API limits.
