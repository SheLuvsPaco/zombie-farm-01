## Real-World Use Case: Multimodal AI
Let's consider a scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to analyze customer feedback across social media, email, and phone calls. With Gemini 2.0, setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden would be moderate (5-10 hours per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $5,000 per month. However, Gemini 2.0's limited long context handling capabilities may lead to incomplete analysis results. In contrast, Claude 3.5 would require 5-7 days for setup, with a higher ongoing maintenance burden (10-20 hours per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $10,000 per month, but Claude 3.5's advanced features and long context handling capabilities would provide more comprehensive analysis results.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Gemini 2.0 to Claude 3.5, data export/import limitations may apply, and training time needed would be around 2-4 weeks. Hidden costs may include additional support fees and potential downtime during the migration process. Conversely, switching from Claude 3.5 to Gemini 2.0 may require significant simplification of existing workflows and potential loss of advanced features.
