## When to Choose Cloudflare
- If you're a large enterprise with complex security requirements, Cloudflare's advanced features, such as DDoS protection and web application firewall, make it a more suitable choice.

## Real-World Use Case: CDN
Let's consider a scenario where a 20-person SaaS company needs to set up a CDN for its web application. With Bunny CDN, the setup process takes around 2 hours, and ongoing maintenance is minimal. The cost breakdown for 100 users and 1,000 actions per day would be approximately $29/month. In contrast, Cloudflare's setup process takes around 5 hours due to its more complex features, and the cost breakdown would be around $40/month. However, Cloudflare's advanced security features and scalability make it a better choice for larger teams or those with complex security requirements.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Bunny CDN to Cloudflare, data export/import limitations may apply, and training time needed to learn Cloudflare's advanced features can take up to 2 weeks. Hidden costs, such as additional support fees, may also arise. Conversely, switching from Cloudflare to Bunny CDN is relatively straightforward, with minimal data export/import limitations and a shorter training time of around 1 week.
