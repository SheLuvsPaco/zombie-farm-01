## The Workflow
The integration workflow involves the following 5-step logic flow:
1. When Shopify receives a new order, it triggers a webhook to notify WooCommerce.

4. WooCommerce receives the updated order status and updates its own order status.
5. The integration synchronizes customer and inventory data between the two platforms.

## Best Practices
To ensure a secure and efficient integration, follow these best practices:
* Use secure API keys and webhooks to protect sensitive data.
* Set up a regular sync frequency to ensure data consistency between the two platforms.
