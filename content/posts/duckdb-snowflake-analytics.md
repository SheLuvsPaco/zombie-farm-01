## When to Choose DuckDB
- If you're a small team (less than 10 people) with a limited budget and simple analytics requirements, DuckDB is a cost-effective solution that can handle small to medium-sized datasets.
- If you're a developer or data scientist with expertise in SQL, DuckDB's flexibility and customizability make it a good choice for building custom analytics applications.
- If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to analyze customer behavior, DuckDB can provide a free, open-source solution for basic analytics capabilities, reducing costs and allowing for more resources to be allocated to other areas of the business.
- If you're working with sensitive data that requires on-premises storage, DuckDB's local deployment option ensures that your data remains secure and compliant with regulations.

## When to Choose Snowflake
- If you're a large team (over 100 people) with complex analytics requirements, Snowflake's cloud-based scalability and extensive integration options make it a better choice for handling large datasets and providing advanced analytics capabilities.
- If you're a business user without extensive SQL expertise, Snowflake's user-friendly interface and pre-built connectors make it easier to get started with analytics and integrate with other tools.
- If you're a 500-person enterprise needing to analyze large datasets and provide data-driven insights to stakeholders, Snowflake's advanced analytics capabilities and scalable architecture make it a better choice for handling complex analytics workloads.
- If you're working with multiple data sources and need to integrate them into a single analytics platform, Snowflake's extensive integration options and data warehousing capabilities make it a better choice for providing a unified view of your data.

## Real-World Use Case: Analytics
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to analyze customer behavior and provide data-driven insights to stakeholders. With DuckDB, setup complexity would be around 2-3 days, with ongoing maintenance burden limited to occasional updates and backups. Cost breakdown for 100 users would be $0, as DuckDB is free and open-source. However, common gotchas include limited scalability and lack of advanced analytics features.

In contrast, Snowflake would require a more complex setup process, taking around 5-7 days, with ongoing maintenance burden including regular monitoring and optimization of query performance. Cost breakdown for 100 users would be around $1,500 per month, depending on usage and query complexity. However, Snowflake provides advanced analytics capabilities, including data warehousing and machine learning, making it a better choice for complex analytics workloads.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between DuckDB and Snowflake, data export/import limitations include the need to transform data into a compatible format, which can take around 1-2 weeks. Training time needed would be around 2-3 weeks, depending on the complexity of the analytics workload and the expertise of the team. Hidden costs include the need to re-architect data pipelines and re-train machine learning models, which can add up to $10,000 to $20,000 in additional costs.
