## Quick Verdict
For teams of 10-50 people with a budget of $1,000-$5,000 per year, Lottie is the better choice for animation due to its ease of use, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, larger teams or those with complex animation requirements may prefer FLIP for its advanced features and customization options. Ultimately, the choice between Lottie and FLIP depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.

## When to Choose Lottie
* If you're a 10-person startup needing a simple, cost-effective animation solution with a gentle learning curve, Lottie is the better choice.
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company with a budget of $2,000-$5,000 per year and requiring scalability and ease of use, Lottie is the better choice.
* If you're a solo developer or small team with limited resources and needing a free, open-source animation solution, Lottie is the better choice.
* If you're working on a project with simple animation requirements and a tight deadline (e.g., 1-3 weeks), Lottie's ease of use and pre-made animations can help you meet your goals.

## When to Choose FLIP
* If you're a 100-person enterprise with a budget of $10,000-$50,000 per year and requiring advanced animation features, customization options, and priority support, FLIP is the better choice.
* If you're a team of experienced developers with complex animation requirements and needing a high degree of control over the animation process, FLIP's advanced features and customization options make it the better choice.
* If you're working on a project with unique animation requirements that can't be met by pre-made animations, FLIP's ability to create custom animations from scratch may be necessary.
* If you're a large team with existing infrastructure and requiring a high degree of integration with other tools and platforms, FLIP's custom quote (enterprise) option may be more suitable.

## Real-World Use Case: Animation
Let's consider a scenario where we need to create a simple animation for a landing page. With Lottie, we can create and deploy the animation in 2-3 hours, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 1-2 hours per month. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be $0 (free, open-source) or $99-$499 per month (premium). In contrast, FLIP would require 5-10 hours to set up, with an ongoing maintenance burden of 2-5 hours per month. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be $99-$499 per month (self-service) or custom quote (enterprise).

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Lottie to FLIP, you'll need to consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Lottie's JSON animation files may not be compatible with FLIP, requiring manual re-creation of animations.
* Training time needed: 1-2 weeks to learn FLIP's advanced features and customization options.
* Hidden costs: Potential costs associated with custom development, priority support, and enterprise licensing.
