# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a common workflow problem faced by sales and marketing teams: the manual transfer of lead and customer data between the two systems. This integration automates the process, reducing the time spent on data entry and minimizing errors. 
- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Syncing contact information, lead status, and sales pipeline data to ensure both teams have the most up-to-date information.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, such as email address and phone number

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead is added to Salesforce with corresponding contact information |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a deal is closed in Salesforce, the corresponding contact in HubSpot can be updated with the new sales information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, such as ensuring that the email address field is mapped correctly

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers on HubSpot sync errors and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel.

## Limitations to Know
- Custom objects in Salesforce may not sync with HubSpot
- Rate limits apply to both HubSpot and Salesforce APIs, with a maximum of 100 requests per minute
- The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need to have at least a Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier account.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but you can also schedule syncs to occur at specific intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can sync historical data from both HubSpot and Salesforce. However, this may require additional setup and configuration to ensure that the data is properly mapped and synced.
