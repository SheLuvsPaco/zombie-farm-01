# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and contact information between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize lead status updates in real-time, ensuring that both sales and marketing teams have the most up-to-date information.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing lead status updates between HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure data consistency and reduce manual data entry.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or Make
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, including lead status, contact information, and company details

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New lead created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead information is synchronized between both platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot, such as when a lead is converted to a contact. This bidirectional data flow ensures that both platforms have the most up-to-date information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by re-connecting the integration in HubSpot settings
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid exceeding API limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure that all necessary fields are synced between HubSpot and Salesforce

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing you to quickly troubleshoot and resolve issues.

## Limitations to Know
- HubSpot's free tier does not support Salesforce integration
- Salesforce has a rate limit of 1,000 API calls per day for the Enterprise tier
- The native integration does not support syncing custom objects between HubSpot and Salesforce

## FAQ
