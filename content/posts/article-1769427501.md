# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the synchronization of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information, lead status, and sales pipeline data to ensure that both marketing and sales teams have a unified view of customer interactions.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing lead and customer data to streamline sales and marketing workflows

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts) and setting up field mappings

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app (e.g., "New Contact in HubSpot")
3. Set Salesforce as the action app (e.g., "Create New Contact in Salesforce")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot's "Email" field to Salesforce's "Email" field

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New lead in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Leads are synchronized in real-time, ensuring sales teams have the latest information |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, you can set up a reverse sync to update HubSpot contacts when changes are made in Salesforce. This ensures that marketing teams always have the most current customer information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by redoing the connection process
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to avoid hitting Salesforce's API limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure that all necessary fields are included in the sync setup

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing for quick intervention and minimizing data discrepancies.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain advanced data types may not sync directly between HubSpot and Salesforce.
- **Rate Limits:** Salesforce has API call limits that can be reached if the sync frequency is too high or if there are a large number of records being synced.
- **Feature Gaps:** Some features, like custom workflows, may not be fully supported in the free or lower tiers of either platform.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot or Salesforce?
A: The integration is available on the Professional or Enterprise tier of HubSpot and the Enterprise or Unlimited tier of Salesforce. The free tier of HubSpot and the lower tiers of Salesforce have limitations on integrations and API access.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data can sync in real-time for many objects, but some data may be synced on a scheduled basis (e.g., every 15 minutes) depending on the setup and the specific objects being synced.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, it is possible to backfill historical data from one platform to the other, but this may require a one-time manual import or a custom setup through Zapier/Make, depending on the volume of data and the specific requirements.
