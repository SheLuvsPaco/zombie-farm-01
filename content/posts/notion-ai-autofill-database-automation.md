# Does Notion Have AI Autofill? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Notion offers property suggestions, which is a form of AI-driven assistance that helps users fill in properties within databases, but it does not have a full-fledged AI Autofill feature like some other tools. This means that while Notion can suggest properties based on the context and content of your database, it may not automatically fill in all the information for you without any manual input.

## How to Use AI Autofill in Notion (If Yes)
Since Notion's property suggestions are the closest feature to AI Autofill, here's how you can utilize them:
1. Navigate to your Notion database and start creating a new page or editing an existing one.
2. Click on a property field where you want to input data, and Notion will start suggesting possible values based on the property type and existing data in your database.
3. Result: Select the appropriate suggestion from the dropdown list to fill in the property field, saving you time and reducing the chance of input errors.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Notion doesn't support full AI Autofill natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to Zapier or Integromat to automate data entry tasks across different apps, which can indirectly help with autofill functionalities.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install plugins like AutoCrat or Formatic to enhance your database automation capabilities, though these might not offer direct AI Autofill.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create templates with pre-filled properties for common database entries, which can then be duplicated and adjusted as needed, providing a makeshift solution for repetitive data entry tasks.

## Better Alternatives for AI Autofill
If AI Autofill is a crucial feature for your Database Automation workflow, consider these alternatives:
- **Alternative 1:** Airtable (Native support) - Offers a more comprehensive set of automation features, including AI-driven data suggestions and fill capabilities.
- **Alternative 2:** Coda (Better implementation) - Provides a robust set of automation and AI-driven tools that can help with data entry and management, potentially offering more advanced AI Autofill functionalities.

## FAQ
Q: Is AI Autofill coming in the roadmap?
A: As of the latest public roadmap updates, Notion has not explicitly announced plans for a full AI Autofill feature, but the company continues to enhance its property suggestions and database automation capabilities.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: Notion's property suggestions are available across all plans, including the free version, meaning that users do not need to be on an Enterprise plan to access this functionality. However, some advanced automation features might be limited to higher-tier plans.
