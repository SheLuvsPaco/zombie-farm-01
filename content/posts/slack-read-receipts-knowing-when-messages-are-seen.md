# Does Slack Have Read Receipts? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: No
No native support (use workarounds). Slack does not have a built-in feature for read receipts, which means users cannot directly see when their messages have been viewed by others. However, there are workarounds and third-party integrations that can provide similar functionality, albeit with some limitations.

## How to Use Read Receipts in Slack (If Yes)
Not applicable, as Slack does not natively support read receipts.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Slack doesn't support this natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to tools like Read Receipts for Slack or Slack Message Status, which can provide read receipt functionality for a fee, with pricing starting at $5 per user per month for a basic plan.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install plugins like Slack Read Receipts or Message Seen, which can be installed for free but may have limitations, such as only working for direct messages or requiring a paid upgrade for full functionality.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually ask the recipient to confirm they have seen the message by typing "seen" or a similar acknowledgement, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, but provides a basic way to confirm message visibility.

## Better Alternatives for Read Receipts
If Read Receipts is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Knowing when messages are seen), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Microsoft Teams (Native support) - provides read receipts for all messages, with no additional cost or setup required, and can be used by teams of up to 500,000 users.
- **Alternative 2:** Flock (Better implementation) - offers read receipts, as well as more advanced features like message scheduling and reminders, with a free plan available for up to 20 users, and paid plans starting at $3 per user per month.

## FAQ
Q: Is Read Receipts coming in the roadmap?
A: According to Slack's public roadmap, there are no plans to add native read receipt functionality in the near future, with the latest update from December 2025 stating that the feature is still under consideration.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, read receipts are not a feature available on any of Slack's pricing tiers, including the Enterprise plan, which starts at $12.50 per user per month, and instead requires the use of workarounds or third-party integrations.
