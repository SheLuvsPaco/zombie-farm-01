## Real-World Use Case: Database
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to handle 10,000 concurrent users, with a mix of transactional and analytical workloads. 
* Setup complexity: SingleStore requires 2-3 days to set up, while PostgreSQL requires 1-2 days.
* Ongoing maintenance burden: SingleStore requires regular monitoring and tuning, while PostgreSQL requires periodic updates and backups.
* Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions: SingleStore costs around $5,000 per year, while PostgreSQL costs around $1,000 per year (with optional support plans).
* Common gotchas: SingleStore requires expertise in distributed databases, while PostgreSQL requires careful planning for scalability.
