4. Zendesk updates the corresponding ticket with the new information.
5. The integrated data is then synced between the two platforms, providing a unified view of the customer's history.

## Best Practices
To ensure a seamless integration, it is essential to prioritize data security and sync frequency. Regularly review and update your API permissions and webhooks to prevent data breaches. Additionally, set up a scheduled sync to ensure that data is updated in real-time.
