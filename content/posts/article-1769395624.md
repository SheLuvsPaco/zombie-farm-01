# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information and sales activity between HubSpot's marketing automation platform and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or Make
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app
3. Set Salesforce as the action app
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot contact properties to Salesforce contact fields

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead is synced with contact information |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a deal is closed in Salesforce, it can update the contact's lifecycle stage in HubSpot, ensuring that marketing automation workflows are triggered based on the latest sales activity.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by reconnecting your Salesforce account in HubSpot's integration settings
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes to comply with Salesforce's API limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping to ensure that all necessary fields are being synced between HubSpot and Salesforce

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, allowing you to address issues before they impact your sales and marketing workflows.

## Limitations to Know
- Custom objects in Salesforce may not sync with HubSpot due to limitations in the native integration
- Salesforce has rate limits on API calls, which can impact the frequency of syncs
- The free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration, requiring at least a Professional tier subscription

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support Salesforce integration. You need at least a Professional tier subscription.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some syncs may be scheduled to comply with API rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, you can backfill historical data from Salesforce into HubSpot during the initial setup of the integration. However, this may be subject to API rate limits and should be planned accordingly.
