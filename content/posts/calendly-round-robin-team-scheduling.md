# Does Calendly Have Round Robin? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Calendly does offer a Round Robin feature, which allows for fair distribution of meetings among team members, ensuring that no single member is overwhelmed with bookings. This feature is particularly useful in team scheduling scenarios where meetings are distributed evenly, promoting a balanced workload.

## How to Use Round Robin in Calendly (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the "Team" section in your Calendly account and select the team for which you want to enable Round Robin.
2. Click on the "Routing" option and choose "Round Robin" as the meeting distribution method.
3. Result: Calendly will then distribute incoming meeting requests evenly among the selected team members, based on their availability and scheduling rules.

## Workarounds (If No)
Not applicable, as Calendly natively supports Round Robin for team scheduling.

- **Alternative 1:** Doodle (Native support with advanced features like automatic scheduling and reminders)
- **Alternative 2:** ScheduleOnce (Better implementation with features like custom routing rules and integration with various calendar systems)
