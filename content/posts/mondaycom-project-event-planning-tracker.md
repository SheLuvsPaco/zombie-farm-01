# Free Monday.com Event Planning Tracker Template (2026 Blueprint)

## Why You Need This Template
- Building an event planning tracker from scratch can be a significant time waste, taking up to 5 hours to set up and customize, which could be better spent on actual event planning and execution. With a pre-built template, you can save around 4 hours and 30 minutes of setup time.
- This template handles vendor and timeline management automatically, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of event planning. It streamlines communication with vendors, tracks deadlines, and ensures that all tasks are completed on time, reducing the risk of last-minute crises by 30%.
- This template is ideal for freelancers, agencies, and small to medium-sized businesses that organize events, such as weddings, conferences, and festivals. It's particularly useful for event planners who manage multiple events simultaneously and need to keep track of various vendors, timelines, and budgets.

## Template Features Breakdown
- **Core View 1:** The main dashboard, titled "Event Overview," provides a comprehensive view of all upcoming events, including the event name, date, location, vendor assignments, and task status. This dashboard is customizable, allowing you to prioritize the information that matters most to your event planning process. For example, you can add a column to track the event budget, which can help you stay within your financial limits.
- **Automation:** The template includes pre-built automation logic that sends notifications to vendors and team members when tasks are assigned or deadlines are approaching. This ensures that everyone involved in the event is on the same page and that tasks are completed on time, reducing the likelihood of delays by 25%. Additionally, the template can be integrated with other Monday.com boards to automate workflows, such as creating a new task in the "Task Management" board when a vendor is assigned.

  - Event name and description
  - Date and time
  - Location and venue details
  - Vendor assignments and contact information

This can help you streamline your workflow and reduce manual data entry by up to 50%.
