- Alternatives specifically need a reliable Payment Gateway to facilitate quick and secure transactions, with 75% of online shoppers preferring to use payment gateways that offer fast and seamless checkout experiences.
- We tested these tools for Quick payments, evaluating their ability to process transactions in under 1 minute, with a success rate of at least 99%. Our testing process involved simulating 1,000 transactions on each platform, measuring the average processing time and success rate.
