# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a common workflow problem for sales and marketing teams: manually updating lead information between the two systems. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by automating the sync process. A key use case for this integration is to ensure that sales teams have the most up-to-date lead information, allowing them to prioritize and follow up with leads more effectively.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Automating lead updates between marketing and sales teams

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger (e.g., "New Contact Created")
3. Set Salesforce as the action (e.g., "Create New Lead")
4. Map fields accordingly, including email, name, and company

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New contact created in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead information is synced between the two systems |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce can also trigger updates in HubSpot. For example, when a lead is updated in Salesforce, the corresponding contact in HubSpot can be updated automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, including ensuring that all necessary fields are mapped between HubSpot and Salesforce

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks. This can be done by creating a new Zap that triggers when an error occurs in the HubSpot-Salesforce integration.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data types:** The integration does not support syncing custom object types
- **Rate limits:** HubSpot has a rate limit of 100 requests per 10 seconds, while Salesforce has a rate limit of 1,000 requests per 24 hours
- **Feature gaps:** The free tier of HubSpot does not support custom object syncing, while the Enterprise tier of Salesforce is required for full API access

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the free tier of HubSpot does not support the Salesforce integration.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time, but can be scheduled to sync at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) to avoid rate limits.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be synced between HubSpot and Salesforce, but this may require manual configuration and may be subject to rate limits.
