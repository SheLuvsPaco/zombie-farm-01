## When to Choose Content Collections
* If you're a large enterprise with complex content needs and a budget over $20,000 per year, Content Collections' advanced scalability and support features make it the better choice.
* If you require advanced content modeling with custom fields and relationships, Content Collections' more robust features make it the way to go.
* If you need priority support and a dedicated account manager, Content Collections' higher-tier plans provide more comprehensive assistance.

## Real-World Use Case: Content Layer
Let's say you're a 20-person marketing team setting up a Content Layer for your company's blog and social media channels. With Keystatic, setup complexity is around 2-3 hours, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low (less than 1 hour per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $500/month. However, with Content Collections, setup complexity increases to 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is higher (around 2-3 hours per week). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be custom-quoted, but likely in the range of $1,500-$3,000 per month. Common gotchas include Keystatic's limited advanced content modeling and Content Collections' steeper learning curve.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between these tools, data export/import limitations are a significant concern. Keystatic allows for easy export of content via CSV, while Content Collections requires a custom migration script. Training time needed for Content Collections is around 1-2 weeks, compared to Keystatic's 1-3 days. Hidden costs include potential custom development fees for Content Collections' advanced features.

Q: Which has better ROI for Content Layer?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, Keystatic's flat-rate pricing and lower setup costs result in a better ROI for small to medium-sized teams (around 20-30% cost savings).
