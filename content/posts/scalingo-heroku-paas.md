## Real-World Use Case: PaaS
Let's consider a scenario where we need to deploy a web application with a small team. With Scalingo, setup complexity is relatively low, requiring only 2-3 hours to set up a basic application. Ongoing maintenance burden is also minimal, with automatic scaling and updates. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately €50-100 per month, depending on the chosen plan. Common gotchas include potential issues with containerization and limited support for certain programming languages. In contrast, Heroku requires 5-7 hours to set up a basic application, with a higher ongoing maintenance burden due to the need to manage add-ons. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions would be approximately $100-200 per month, depending on the chosen plan.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between these tools, data export/import limitations may apply, with Scalingo offering a more streamlined migration process. Training time needed to adapt to the new platform can range from 1-5 days, depending on the team's size and experience. Hidden costs, such as add-on fees or support costs, can add up to 20% to your overall bill.
