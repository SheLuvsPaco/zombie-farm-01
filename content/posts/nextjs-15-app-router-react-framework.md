# Does Next.js 15 Have App Router? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Next.js 15 introduces the App Router, a significant improvement for server components migration, allowing for more efficient and flexible routing. However, the migration process may require adjustments to existing codebases, as the App Router replaces the traditional pages directory with a new app directory, affecting how routes are defined and handled.

## How to Use App Router in Next.js 15
1. Navigate to the `app` directory in your Next.js 15 project, where you will define your routes using a file-system-based approach.
2. Click on a specific route file (e.g., `dashboard/page.js`) to edit its content and configure the route as needed.
3. Result: The App Router will automatically handle the routing for you, providing a more streamlined and efficient experience for both developers and users, with features like automatic route generation and improved internationalization support.

## Workarounds (If No)
Not applicable, as Next.js 15 does support App Router natively.

## Better Alternatives for App Router
If App Router is a critical feature for your workflow (React Framework) and you're looking for alternative tools, consider:
- **Alternative 1:** Remix (Native support) - Offers a robust routing system with built-in support for nested routes and route parameters.
- **Alternative 2:** Gatsby (Better implementation) - Provides a powerful routing system with features like automatic code splitting and optimized image loading.

## FAQ
Q: Is App Router coming in the roadmap?
A: The App Router is already available in Next.js 15, and its development is actively ongoing, with new features and improvements being added regularly, as seen in the official Next.js roadmap and GitHub repository.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, the App Router is available in all plans, including the free and open-source version of Next.js, making it accessible to developers of all levels and project sizes.
