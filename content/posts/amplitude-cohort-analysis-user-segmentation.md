# Does Amplitude Have Cohort Analysis? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Amplitude offers cohort analysis as a core feature on all its plans, allowing users to segment their audience based on specific behaviors or characteristics over time. This feature enables practitioners to analyze user retention, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve their product or service.

## How to Use Cohort Analysis in Amplitude
1. Navigate to the "Cohort" section within the Amplitude platform, where you can create and manage your cohorts.
2. Click on "Create Cohort" and define your cohort criteria, such as the specific event or set of events that users must have performed, and the time range for the cohort.
3. Result: Amplitude will generate a cohort chart showing the retention rate of users over time, allowing you to analyze and compare the behavior of different cohorts, such as users who signed up during a specific time period or users who performed a specific action.

## Workarounds (Not Applicable)
Since Amplitude natively supports cohort analysis, there is no need for workarounds. However, if you're looking to integrate Amplitude with other tools for more advanced analysis, you can explore Amplitude's integration options.

If you're evaluating Amplitude against other tools for cohort analysis, consider the following alternatives:
- **Alternative 1:** Mixpanel (Native support with advanced filtering options)
- **Alternative 2:** Google Analytics 4 (Better implementation with automated cohort creation)
