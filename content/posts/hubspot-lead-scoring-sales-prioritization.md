# Does HubSpot Have Lead Scoring? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
HubSpot does have lead scoring, but it requires a Marketing Hub Professional subscription or higher. This means that businesses using the free or basic plans will not have access to this feature, and will need to upgrade to take advantage of lead scoring capabilities.

## How to Use Lead Scoring in HubSpot (If Yes)
1. Navigate to the "Contacts" section in your HubSpot portal and click on "Lead Scoring" to access the feature.
2. Click on "Create a lead score" to set up a new scoring rule, and then define the criteria that will determine the score, such as form submissions, email opens, or page views.
3. Result: HubSpot will automatically assign a score to each contact based on their interactions with your website and marketing materials, allowing you to prioritize leads and focus on the most promising opportunities.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since HubSpot's lead scoring feature is only available on the Marketing Hub Professional plan, users on lower tiers can consider the following workarounds:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a tool like Calendly or Mailchimp to leverage their lead scoring capabilities and sync the data back to HubSpot.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Leadfeeder or Leadberry to access lead scoring functionality within HubSpot.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually assign scores to contacts based on their interactions, using a spreadsheet or custom properties in HubSpot to track the data, although this approach can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

## Better Alternatives for Lead Scoring
If Lead Scoring is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Sales Prioritization), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Pardot (Native support) - offers advanced lead scoring and grading capabilities.
- **Alternative 2:** Marketo (Better implementation) - provides a more comprehensive lead scoring system with automated scoring and routing.

## FAQ
Q: Is Lead Scoring coming in the roadmap?
A: According to HubSpot's public roadmap, there are no plans to add lead scoring to the free or basic plans, but the company is continuously improving and expanding the feature for Marketing Hub Professional users.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, lead scoring is available on the Marketing Hub Professional plan, which is a lower tier than the Enterprise plan, making it more accessible to smaller businesses and teams.
