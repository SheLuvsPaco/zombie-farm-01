## Real-World Use Case: Kubernetes Dev
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person team needs to deploy a web application on Kubernetes. With Blimp, the setup complexity is relatively low, taking around 2-3 days to get started. Okteto, on the other hand, requires more time and expertise, taking around 1-2 weeks to set up. The ongoing maintenance burden is also higher with Okteto, requiring more frequent updates and monitoring. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is as follows:
* Blimp: $500/month (flat rate)
* Okteto: $2,000/month (tiered pricing)
Common gotchas with both tools include ensuring proper cluster configuration and monitoring resource utilization.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Blimp and Okteto, consider the following:
* Data export/import limitations: Blimp allows for easy export of deployment configurations, while Okteto requires more manual effort.
* Training time needed: Okteto requires more training time due to its steeper learning curve, taking around 1-2 weeks.
* Hidden costs: Okteto's tiered pricing can lead to unexpected costs if not properly planned for.
