# Free Linear Bug Tracking System Template (2026 Blueprint)

## Why You Need This Template
Building a bug tracking system from scratch can be a significant time waste, taking up to 10 hours of development time, according to a survey by GitLab. This template handles standardized issue reporting for dev teams automatically, streamlining the process and reducing the average reporting time from 15 minutes to 2 minutes. This template is ideal for freelancers, agencies, and small to medium-sized development teams who need a reliable and efficient way to track and manage bugs.

## Template Features Breakdown
- **Core View 1:** The main dashboard, titled "Bug Tracker," displays a table with key columns such as "Issue ID," "Title," "Description," "Status," "Priority," and "Assignee." This view provides a clear overview of all ongoing issues, allowing teams to quickly identify and prioritize bugs.
- **Automation:** The template includes pre-built logic to automatically assign a unique "Issue ID" to each new bug report and set the "Status" to "Open" by default. This ensures consistency in issue tracking and reduces manual errors.
- **Fields Included:** The template includes the following key data points:
  * Issue ID
  * Title
  * Description
  * Status (with options for "Open," "In Progress," and "Resolved")
  * Priority (with options for "Low," "Medium," and "High")
  * Assignee
  * Reported By
  * Created At
