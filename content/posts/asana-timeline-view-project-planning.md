# Does Asana Have Timeline View? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
Asana does have a Timeline View feature, but it is only available to users with a Premium subscription or higher. This means that free or basic plan users will not have access to this feature, limiting its utility for smaller projects or personal use cases.

## How to Use Timeline View in Asana (If Yes)
1. Navigate to your project dashboard in Asana and ensure you have a Premium subscription.
2. Click on the "Timeline" tab, usually found alongside other view options like List, Board, or Calendar.
3. Result: You will see a visual representation of your tasks and deadlines laid out on a timeline, allowing you to easily identify dependencies, overlaps, and potential bottlenecks in your project schedule.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Asana's Timeline View is a premium feature, users without access to it can consider the following workarounds:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect Asana to Instagantt, a project management tool that offers Gantt chart and timeline views, to visualize your Asana tasks in a timeline format.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install the GanttPRO plugin, which integrates with Asana to provide a timeline view of your tasks and projects.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually create a timeline view by using Asana's Calendar view and adjusting the zoom level to show a broader timeframe, then screenshot and annotate it in a separate document or tool to mimic a timeline view.

## Better Alternatives for Timeline View
If Timeline View is a critical feature for your project planning workflow and you're not keen on Asana's premium pricing, consider these alternatives:
- **Alternative 1:** Trello (with its built-in Calendar Power-Up) offers a native calendar view that can be used similarly to a timeline for planning.
- **Alternative 2:** Microsoft Planner provides a built-in timeline view, making it a more straightforward choice for teams already invested in the Microsoft ecosystem.

## FAQ
Q: Is Timeline View coming in the roadmap for free or basic plans?
A: As of the last public roadmap update, there are no indications that Asana plans to make Timeline View available to non-Premium users.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, the Timeline View feature is available to all Asana users with a Premium subscription or higher, not exclusively to the Enterprise plan. However, Enterprise plans may offer additional features or support that can enhance the utility of Timeline View for large-scale project planning.
