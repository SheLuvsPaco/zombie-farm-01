## The Workflow
Here is a 5-step logic flow for integrating HubSpot and Customer.io:

3. Based on the updated profile, Customer.io triggers a personalized campaign to the user.
4. Customer.io sends the campaign data back to HubSpot via API, updating the user's contact record.
5. HubSpot syncs the updated contact record with the CRM, ensuring that all customer data is up-to-date.

## Best Practices
To ensure data security and sync frequency, follow these tips:
* Use secure API keys and webhooks to protect customer data.
* Set up regular syncs (e.g., every 15 minutes) to ensure data consistency between HubSpot and Customer.io.
