# Automating Form Leads to CRM: A Guide for HubSpot and Typeform
As a B2B team, integrating HubSpot and Typeform can significantly improve your lead management process. By automating the conversion of high-intent Typeform submissions into HubSpot contacts, you can enhance your sales team's productivity and conversion rates.

## Introduction
The integration of HubSpot and Typeform allows B2B teams to streamline their lead generation and management process. By connecting these two tools, you can automatically create new contacts in HubSpot whenever a lead submits a Typeform, ensuring that your sales team has access to the most up-to-date and accurate lead information.

## Feature Comparison
| Feature | HubSpot Capability | Typeform Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Form Creation | Limited form customization options | Advanced form customization options with conditional logic |
| Lead Management | Robust contact and lead management features | Limited lead management capabilities |
| Automation | Advanced workflow automation features | Limited automation features |

## Technical Prerequisites
To integrate HubSpot and Typeform, you will need:
* HubSpot API key
* Typeform API key or webhook setup

## The Workflow
Here is a 5-step logic flow for integrating HubSpot and Typeform:
1. A lead submits a Typeform.
2. Typeform triggers a webhook or API call to HubSpot.
3. HubSpot receives the lead information and creates a new contact.
4. HubSpot assigns the correct properties and source attribution to the new contact.
5. The sales team can then access the new contact information in HubSpot.

## Best Practices
To ensure a smooth integration, make sure to:
* Implement data security measures to protect sensitive lead information.
* Set up a regular sync frequency to ensure that lead information is up-to-date.

> [!TIP]
> **Pro-Tip:** Use a separate property in HubSpot to track the source of the lead (e.g., "Typeform Submission") to enable better attribution and analytics.

## FAQ
Q: How often should I sync my Typeform submissions with HubSpot?
A: It's recommended to sync your Typeform submissions with HubSpot at least once a day to ensure that your lead information is up-to-date.
Q: Can I customize the properties that are assigned to new contacts in HubSpot?
A: Yes, you can customize the properties that are assigned to new contacts in HubSpot using the HubSpot API or workflow automation features.
Q: What happens if a lead submits a Typeform multiple times?
A: If a lead submits a Typeform multiple times, HubSpot will update the existing contact information instead of creating a new contact, ensuring that you don't have duplicate contacts in your system.
