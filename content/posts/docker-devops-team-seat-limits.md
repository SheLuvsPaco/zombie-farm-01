# Docker Pricing 2026: The True Cost Explained

As a B2B procurement consultant, it's essential to understand the pricing structure of Docker, a popular containerization platform. In this analysis, we'll break down the official tiers, hidden costs, and provide a comparison with competitors to help you make an informed decision.

## The Official Tiers (Simplified)
| Plan | Price | Key Limit | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | $0 | 1 concurrent build, 1 automated test | Testing |
| Starter | $7/month | 5 concurrent builds, 5 automated tests | Solopreneurs |
| Pro | $21/month | 10 concurrent builds, 10 automated tests | Scaling Teams |

## The "Hidden" Costs They Don't Mention
- **Seat Costs:** Docker pricing is based on a per-user model, with each user requiring a separate seat. This can quickly add up, especially for larger teams. For example, a team of 10 users would require 10 Pro plan subscriptions, totaling $210/month.
- **Add-ons:** Additional features like API access and Single Sign-On (SSO) are included in the Pro plan, but may incur extra costs for larger teams or enterprises.
- **Overage Fees:** If you exceed the concurrent build or automated test limits, you'll need to upgrade to a higher plan or purchase additional seats. This is where Docker Hub Pro comes into play, offering more features and support for larger teams. For instance, if you have a team of 20 users and need more than 10 concurrent builds, you'll need to upgrade to Docker Hub Pro, which costs $60/month per user.

## Comparison: Is it Worth It?
- vs Competitor A (Cheaper?): Competitor A offers a similar platform for $5/month per user, but with limited features and support. While it may seem cheaper, the lack of features and support may outweigh the cost savings.
- vs Competitor B (Better value?): Competitor B offers a more comprehensive platform for $30/month per user, with additional features like advanced security and priority support. While it's more expensive, the added features and support may be worth the investment for larger teams.

## Strategic Recommendation
- **Buy the Pro plan if:** You need more than 5 concurrent builds or automated tests, or require advanced features like SSO and API access. Additionally, if you have a team of 10 or more users, the Pro plan is likely the most cost-effective option.
- **Stay on Free if:** You have less than 5 users and only need basic features for testing and development.
- **Negotiation Tip:** For enterprises, consider negotiating a custom plan with Docker, which can offer discounts for large teams and long-term commitments. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your team size, usage, and requirements to secure the best possible deal.

## FAQ
Q: Is there a startup discount?
A: Yes, Docker offers a startup discount program for eligible startups, which can provide up to 50% off the Pro plan for the first year.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
A: Docker offers a monthly subscription model, allowing you to cancel or upgrade your plan at any time. However, annual commitments may be required for larger teams or enterprises, with penalties for early cancellation. Be sure to review the contract terms carefully before signing up.
