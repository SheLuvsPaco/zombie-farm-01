# Flyte vs Prefect: Which is Better for Workflow?

## Quick Verdict
For teams focused on machine learning workflows, Flyte is the better choice due to its native integration with ML frameworks and automated hyperparameter tuning, which can reduce model training time by up to 30%. However, Prefect's more extensive library of pre-built tasks and easier learning curve make it a better fit for general workflow automation. Budget-conscious teams with fewer than 20 users may prefer Prefect's more affordable pricing model.

## When to Choose Flyte
* If you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to automate complex machine learning workflows, Flyte's native ML framework support and automated hyperparameter tuning can reduce model training time by up to 30%.
* For teams with existing ML infrastructure, Flyte's custom quote-based pricing model may be more cost-effective for large-scale deployments.
* If your team requires advanced workflow management features, such as real-time monitoring and visual workflow editing, Flyte's capabilities make it a better choice.
* For example, a 20-person data science team at a fintech company can use Flyte to automate their model training and deployment workflows, reducing the time spent on manual tuning by 25%.

## When to Choose Prefect
* If you're a 10-person startup with limited budget and workflow automation needs, Prefect's $25/user/month pricing model and free plan make it a more affordable choice.
* For general workflow automation tasks, such as data ingestion and processing, Prefect's extensive library of pre-built tasks and easier learning curve make it a better fit.
* If your team requires a high degree of customization and flexibility in their workflow automation, Prefect's open-source core and large community of contributors make it a better choice.
* For example, a 5-person marketing team at an e-commerce company can use Prefect to automate their data ingestion and processing workflows, reducing the time spent on manual data processing by 40%.

## Real-World Use Case: Workflow
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 50-person SaaS company needs to automate their machine learning workflow. With Flyte, the setup complexity is around 2-3 days, and the ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low due to its automated hyperparameter tuning and native ML framework support. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $10,000/year. Common gotchas include the need for custom quote-based pricing and the steeper learning curve. In contrast, Prefect's setup complexity is around 1-2 days, and the ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low due to its extensive library of pre-built tasks. The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is around $2,500/month.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Flyte and Prefect, data export/import limitations are a significant concern, as both tools have different data formats and structures. Training time needed to migrate is around 1-2 weeks, depending on the complexity of the workflows. Hidden costs include the need for custom development and potential downtime during the migration process.
