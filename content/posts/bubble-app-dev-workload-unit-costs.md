# Bubble Pricing 2026: The True Cost Explained

As a B2B procurement consultant, it's essential to understand the true cost of using Bubble, a popular no-code development platform. With the new 2026 usage billing, it's crucial to analyze the pricing structure to make informed decisions. In this article, we'll break down the official tiers, hidden costs, and provide a comparison with competitors to help you determine if Bubble is worth it for your business.

## The Official Tiers (Simplified)
| Plan | Price | Key Limit | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | $0 | 100 contacts, 10 pages | Testing |
| Starter | $29/month | 1,000 contacts, 50 pages | Solopreneurs |
| Pro | $129/month | 10,000 contacts, 500 pages | Scaling Teams |

## The "Hidden" Costs They Don't Mention
- **Seat Costs:** Bubble charges $10 per additional user, which can add up quickly for larger teams. For example, if you have 10 users, you'll pay an extra $90 per month.
- **Add-ons:** API access and SSO (Single Sign-On) are available as add-ons, priced at $20 and $50 per month, respectively. These features are essential for integrating Bubble with other tools and ensuring secure authentication.
- **Overage Fees:** With the new 2026 usage billing, Bubble charges $0.01 per additional contact and $0.05 per additional page. This can lead to significant costs if you exceed the limits. For instance, if you have 15,000 contacts on the Pro plan, you'll incur an additional $50 per month in overage fees.

## Comparison: Is it Worth It?
- **vs Competitor A (Adalo):** Adalo offers a similar no-code development platform with a more competitive pricing structure. Their Pro plan costs $50 per month, with fewer limitations on contacts and pages. However, Adalo lacks some of Bubble's advanced features, such as API access and SSO.
- **vs Competitor B (Webflow):** Webflow is a more comprehensive platform that includes no-code development, CMS, and e-commerce features. Their Pro plan costs $35 per month, but it's limited to 1,000 contacts and 100 pages. Webflow's pricing structure is more complex, with additional costs for e-commerce features and CMS.

## Strategic Recommendation
- **Buy the Pro plan if:** You need advanced features like API access, SSO, and priority support. The Pro plan is suitable for scaling teams with a large number of contacts and pages.
- **Stay on Free if:** You have less than 100 contacts and 10 pages. The Free plan is ideal for testing and small projects.
- **Negotiation Tip:** If you're an enterprise customer, you can negotiate a custom plan with Bubble. Ask about their enterprise pricing, which can include discounts for large teams and additional features.

## FAQ
Q: Is there a startup discount?
A: Yes, Bubble offers a 20% discount for startups with less than $1 million in annual revenue. You'll need to provide documentation to verify your startup status.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
A: Yes, Bubble offers a month-to-month contract, and you can cancel at any time. However, if you're on an annual plan, you'll need to pay the remaining balance if you cancel before the end of the term.

By understanding the true cost of using Bubble, including the hidden costs and overage fees, you can make an informed decision about which plan is best for your business. Remember to consider your specific needs and negotiate a custom plan if necessary. With the right plan, Bubble can be a valuable tool for your no-code development needs.
