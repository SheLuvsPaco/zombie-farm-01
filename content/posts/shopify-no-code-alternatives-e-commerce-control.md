# **Breaking Free from Shopify: Exploring No-Code Alternatives for E-commerce Control and Lower Transaction Fees**

As e-commerce businesses continue to grow, the need for control over online stores and reduction of transaction fees becomes increasingly important. Shopify, a popular e-commerce platform, charges transaction fees ranging from 2.4% + 30¢ to 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction, depending on the plan. For businesses looking to minimize these costs and gain more control over their e-commerce operations, no-code alternatives offer a promising solution.

## **Understanding No-Code E-commerce Platforms**
No-code e-commerce platforms allow users to create and manage online stores without requiring extensive coding knowledge. These platforms provide drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built templates, and integrations with various payment gateways, making it easier for businesses to set up and run their e-commerce operations. Some popular no-code alternatives to Shopify include WooCommerce, BigCommerce, and Squarespace.

## **Comparison of No-Code E-commerce Platforms**
The following table compares the key features and transaction fees of Shopify and some no-code alternatives:

| Platform | Transaction Fees | Customization Options | Integration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## **Step-by-Step Process to Migrate from Shopify to a No-Code Alternative**
Migrating from Shopify to a no-code alternative involves several steps:
