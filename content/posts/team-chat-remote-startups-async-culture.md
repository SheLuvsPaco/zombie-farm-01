# 5 Best Team Chat Tools for Remote Startups in 2026

## Why Remote Startups Need Specific Tools
- Generic tools fail because they often lack the asynchronous features necessary for remote teams to collaborate effectively, leading to missed messages, delayed responses, and decreased productivity.
- Remote Startups specifically need Async Culture, which enables team members to work independently and respond to messages at their own pace, reducing the need for immediate responses and minimizing distractions.
- We tested these tools for threaded conversations and voice messages, two essential features for async communication, and evaluated their ability to support remote teams in achieving their goals.

## The Top 3 Contenders

- **Price:** $7.25/mo (paid tier)
