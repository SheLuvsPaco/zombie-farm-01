## Quick Verdict
For small to medium-sized teams with a budget under $1,000 per month, Shopify is a better choice due to its ease of use and comprehensive features. However, for larger teams or those with custom requirements, WooCommerce offers more flexibility and scalability. Ultimately, the choice between Shopify and WooCommerce depends on your specific e-commerce needs and technical expertise.

## When to Choose Shopify
- If you're a 10-person retail business needing a simple, user-friendly online store with built-in features like abandoned cart recovery, Shopify is a better choice.
- For teams with limited technical expertise, Shopify's ease of use and 24/7 support make it a more suitable option.
- If you're a small business with a budget under $500 per month, Shopify's pricing plans are more affordable.
- For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing a straightforward e-commerce solution with minimal customization, Shopify is a better fit.

## When to Choose WooCommerce
- If you're a large enterprise with custom e-commerce requirements, WooCommerce offers more flexibility and scalability due to its open-source nature and extensive library of extensions.
- For teams with technical expertise, WooCommerce's customizability and lower costs make it a more attractive option.
- If you're an e-commerce business with a large product catalog (over 10,000 products), WooCommerce's unlimited product capacity is a significant advantage.
- For instance, if you're a 100-person e-commerce company needing a high degree of customization and integration with other WordPress plugins, WooCommerce is a better choice.

## Real-World Use Case: E-commerce Platforms
Let's consider a scenario where an online store needs to handle 100 orders per day, with a product catalog of 5,000 items. 
- Setup complexity: Shopify takes around 2-3 days to set up, while WooCommerce requires 5-7 days due to its more complex configuration.
- Ongoing maintenance burden: Shopify's automated updates and 24/7 support reduce the maintenance burden, while WooCommerce requires more manual updates and community-driven support.
- Cost breakdown for 100 users/actions: Shopify's basic plan ($29/month) can handle 100 orders per day, while WooCommerce's costs depend on the extensions and plugins used (estimated $50-$100/month).
- Common gotchas: Shopify's transaction fees (2.9% + 30¢ per transaction) can add up, while WooCommerce's open-source nature requires more technical expertise to troubleshoot issues.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between Shopify and WooCommerce:
- Data export/import limitations: Shopify's data export is limited to 50,000 items, while WooCommerce's data export is more flexible.
- Training time needed: Shopify's user-friendly interface requires minimal training (1-3 days), while WooCommerce's more complex setup requires 3-7 days of training.
- Hidden costs: Shopify's transaction fees and app costs can add up, while WooCommerce's extension and plugin costs can be unpredictable.
