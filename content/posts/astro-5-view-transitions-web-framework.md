# Does Astro 5 Have View Transitions? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Sort of
Astro 5 supports client-side navigation, which enables fast and efficient page transitions, but it does not have built-in view transitions like some other web frameworks. This means that while Astro 5 provides a foundation for smooth navigation, developers may need to implement additional logic or use third-party libraries to achieve complex view transitions.

## How to Use View Transitions in Astro 5 (If Yes)
Since Astro 5 does not have native view transitions, the following steps outline how to achieve similar functionality using client-side navigation:
1. Navigate to the Astro 5 documentation on client-side navigation to understand how to set up routes and pages for seamless transitions.
2. Click on the "Routing" section to learn about the different routing options available, such as static and dynamic routing.
3. Result: By leveraging Astro 5's client-side navigation capabilities, developers can create fast and efficient page transitions, although this may require additional customization to achieve the desired view transition effects.

## Workarounds (If No)
Since Astro 5 doesn't support view transitions natively, you can:
1. **Use an Integration:** Connect to a library like React Transition Group to manage complex view transitions and animations.
2. **Use a 3rd Party Plugin:** Install a plugin like Astro-Transition to simplify the process of adding view transitions to your Astro 5 application.
3. **The "Hack":** Manually implement view transitions using CSS animations and JavaScript event listeners to control the transition effects between pages.

## Better Alternatives for View Transitions
If View Transitions is a dealbreaker for your workflow (Web Framework), these tools have it built-in:
- **Alternative 1:** Next.js (Native support) - Next.js provides built-in support for page transitions and animations, making it a popular choice for developers who need advanced view transition capabilities.
- **Alternative 2:** Nuxt.js (Better implementation) - Nuxt.js offers a robust set of features for managing page transitions, including built-in support for animations and transitions.

## FAQ
Q: Is View Transitions coming in the roadmap?
A: According to the Astro 5 public roadmap, there are plans to improve the client-side navigation features, but there is no specific mention of native view transitions.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, Astro 5's client-side navigation features are available in all plans, including the free plan, so developers can start building and testing their applications without incurring additional costs.
