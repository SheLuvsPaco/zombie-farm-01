# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams by automating the transfer of lead and customer data between the two platforms. This integration saves teams an average of 5 hours per week by reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of data inconsistencies. A common use case for this integration is to synchronize contact information and sales activity between HubSpot's marketing automation platform and Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

- **Time Saved:** 5 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Synchronizing contact information and sales activity between marketing automation and CRM systems.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Professional or Enterprise tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Salesforce credentials
4. Configure sync options, such as choosing which objects to sync (e.g., contacts, leads, accounts) and setting the sync frequency (e.g., every 15 minutes)

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited or you need more customization:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario in Zapier or Make
2. Set HubSpot as the trigger app (e.g., "New Contact in HubSpot")
3. Set Salesforce as the action app (e.g., "Create New Contact in Salesforce")
4. Map fields accordingly, such as mapping HubSpot's "Email" field to Salesforce's "Email" field

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Sync
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New lead in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Lead information is synchronized between both platforms |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
For bidirectional data flow, you can set up a reverse sync where updates made in Salesforce are synced back to HubSpot. This ensures that both systems have the most up-to-date information.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens by reconnecting your Salesforce account in HubSpot's integration settings
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 30 minutes to avoid hitting Salesforce's API rate limits
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping and ensure that all necessary fields are included in the sync configuration

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when the sync breaks, allowing you to quickly investigate and resolve the issue.

## Limitations to Know
- **Data Types:** Custom objects and certain custom fields may not sync due to limitations in the native integration or API restrictions.
- **Rate Limits:** Salesforce has API call limits that can be hit if the sync frequency is too high or if there are a large number of records being synced.
- **Feature Gaps:** Some features, like advanced workflow automation, may only be available in higher tiers of either platform.

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the integration requires at least the Professional tier of HubSpot.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but can be scheduled to sync at specific intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) depending on the configuration.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, historical data can be backfilled into Salesforce from HubSpot during the initial setup of the integration, but this may require additional configuration and potentially custom scripting.
