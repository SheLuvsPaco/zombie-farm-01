# Does GitHub Have Actions? (2026 Update)

## The Short Answer: Yes
GitHub Actions is a feature that allows for workflow automation, enabling developers to automate their build, test, and deployment pipeline. This feature provides a flexible way to automate workflows, with support for a wide range of languages and frameworks, and can be triggered by various events such as push, pull request, or schedule.

## How to Use Actions in GitHub (If Yes)
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on the "Actions" tab.
2. Click on the "New workflow" button to create a new workflow, and choose a template or start from scratch.
3. Result: Your workflow will be triggered according to the events you specified, and you can view the workflow run history, including logs and artifacts, to monitor and debug your workflow.

## Workarounds (If No)
Not applicable, as GitHub supports Actions natively.

## Better Alternatives for Actions
If GitHub Actions is not sufficient for your workflow (CI/CD) needs, these tools have built-in support for workflow automation:
- **Alternative 1:** GitLab CI/CD (Native support)
- **Alternative 2:** CircleCI (Better implementation)

## FAQ
Q: Is Actions coming in the roadmap?
A: GitHub Actions is already a mature feature, and while there may be rumors of new features or enhancements, the public roadmap does not indicate any significant changes to the core functionality.

Q: Is this feature gated to the Enterprise plan?
A: No, GitHub Actions is available on all plans, including the free plan, with some limitations on the number of workflow runs and storage. The Enterprise plan provides additional features, such as single sign-on and audit logs, but the core Actions feature is available to all users.
