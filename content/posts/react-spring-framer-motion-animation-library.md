# React Spring vs Framer Motion: Which is Better for Animation Library?

## Quick Verdict
For teams of 10-50 developers with a moderate budget, React Spring is a better choice for animation libraries due to its advanced spring physics features and cost-effective pricing model. However, for smaller teams or those with simple animation needs, Framer Motion's ease of use and generous free plan make it a more suitable option. Ultimately, the choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.

## Feature Comparison Table
| Feature Category | React Spring | Framer Motion | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Pricing Model | $99/year (basic), $299/year (pro) | Free (limited), $12/month (pro) | React Spring (cost-effective for large teams) |
| Learning Curve | Steep (requires knowledge of spring physics) | Gentle (easy to learn, intuitive API) | Framer Motion (easier for beginners) |
| Integrations | React, React Native, Web | React, React Native, Web, Figma | Framer Motion (broader integration with design tools) |
| Scalability | High (handles complex animations with ease) | Medium (may struggle with very complex animations) | React Spring (better for large-scale applications) |
| Support | Good (active community, documentation) | Excellent (responsive support team, extensive resources) | Framer Motion (superior support experience) |
| Spring Physics | Advanced (realistic motion, flexible customization) | Basic (limited customization options) | React Spring (more advanced spring physics features) |
| Animation Library Features | Advanced (keyframe animations, gesture handling) | Basic (simple animations, limited gesture support) | React Spring (more comprehensive animation library features) |

## When to Choose React Spring
* If you're a 20-person frontend team building a complex web application with intricate animations, React Spring's advanced spring physics and customization options make it a better fit.
* For large-scale SaaS companies with 50+ developers, React Spring's cost-effective pricing model and high scalability make it a more suitable choice.
* If your team requires precise control over animation timing and physics, React Spring's advanced features will provide the necessary flexibility.
* For example, if you're a 50-person SaaS company needing to create a custom onboarding experience with complex animations, React Spring's advanced features and cost-effective pricing make it a better choice.

## When to Choose Framer Motion
* If you're a small team of 5-10 developers with simple animation needs, Framer Motion's ease of use and generous free plan make it a more suitable option.
* For teams with limited budget or resources, Framer Motion's free plan and lower pricing tier make it a more affordable choice.
* If your team prioritizes ease of use and rapid prototyping, Framer Motion's intuitive API and gentle learning curve make it a better fit.
* For example, if you're a 10-person startup building a simple web application with basic animations, Framer Motion's ease of use and free plan make it a more suitable choice.

## Real-World Use Case: Animation Library
Let's consider a scenario where we need to create a custom animation library for a web application. With React Spring, setup complexity is around 2-3 days, and ongoing maintenance burden is moderate (5-10 hours/month). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is approximately $500/year (basic plan). Common gotchas include the steep learning curve and potential performance issues with complex animations. In contrast, Framer Motion requires around 1-2 days for setup, with a lower ongoing maintenance burden (2-5 hours/month). The cost breakdown for 100 users/actions is approximately $120/year (pro plan). However, Framer Motion's animation library features are more limited, and customization options are restricted.

## Migration Considerations
If switching between React Spring and Framer Motion, data export/import limitations are moderate (some manual effort required). Training time needed is around 1-2 weeks, depending on the team's familiarity with the new tool. Hidden costs include potential performance optimization issues and the need for additional customization work.

## FAQ
Q: Which tool has better support for gesture handling?
A: React Spring has more advanced gesture handling features, including support for custom gestures and gesture recognition. Framer Motion's gesture support is more limited, but still suitable for simple use cases.

Q: Can I use both React Spring and Framer Motion together?
A: Yes, it's possible to use both tools together, but it may require additional setup and customization work. React Spring can be used for complex animations, while Framer Motion can be used for simpler animations and prototyping.

Q: Which tool has better ROI for Animation Library?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, React Spring's cost-effective pricing model and advanced features provide a better ROI for large teams with complex animation needs. However, for small teams with simple animation needs, Framer Motion's free plan and lower pricing tier make it a more cost-effective option.
