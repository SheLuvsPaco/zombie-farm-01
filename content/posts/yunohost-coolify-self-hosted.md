## Real-World Use Case: Self-hosted
Let's consider a real-world scenario where a 20-person marketing team needs to self-host their project management tools. With Yunohost, the setup process would take around 2-3 days, requiring significant technical expertise. Ongoing maintenance would require approximately 2 hours per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would be $0, as Yunohost is free and open-source. However, the team would need to consider the cost of hardware and infrastructure. Common gotchas include the steep learning curve and potential scalability issues if not properly configured.

In contrast, Coolify would take around 1 day to set up, with minimal technical expertise required. Ongoing maintenance would require approximately 1 hour per week. The cost breakdown for 100 users would still be $0, as Coolify is also free and open-source. However, the team would need to consider the limitations of Coolify's scalability and customization options.

## Migration Considerations
If switching from Yunohost to Coolify, data export/import limitations would be a significant concern, as Coolify has limited support for importing data from other platforms. Training time would be minimal, as Coolify's interface is user-friendly and easy to learn. However, hidden costs could include the need for additional hardware or infrastructure to support Coolify's limited scalability.

## FAQ
Q: Which platform is more secure for self-hosting?
A: Yunohost is generally considered more secure, as it provides full control over data and advanced security features, such as encryption and access controls. However, Coolify's simplicity and limited customization options can also make it a more secure choice, as there are fewer potential vulnerabilities to exploit.

Q: Can I use both Yunohost and Coolify together?
A: Yes, it is possible to use both platforms together, but it would require significant technical expertise and customization. For example, you could use Yunohost as the primary self-hosting platform and integrate Coolify for specific apps or services.

Q: Which platform has better ROI for self-hosting?
A: Based on a 12-month projection, Yunohost is likely to have a better ROI for self-hosting, as it provides more comprehensive features and scalability, despite its steeper learning curve. However, Coolify's simplicity and ease of use can still provide significant cost savings, especially for small teams or those with limited technical expertise.
