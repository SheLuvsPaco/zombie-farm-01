# How to Connect HubSpot to Salesforce (2026 Guide)

## Why This Integration Matters
The integration of HubSpot and Salesforce solves a significant workflow problem for sales and marketing teams, who often struggle with data silos and manual data entry. By connecting these two tools, teams can automate lead tracking, contact management, and sales pipeline updates, reducing manual errors and increasing productivity. 
- **Time Saved:** 10 hours/week
- **Use Case:** Streamlining lead management and sales pipeline tracking for a mid-sized B2B company.

## Quick Setup (Under 5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Active HubSpot account (Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier)
- [ ] Active Salesforce account (Enterprise or Unlimited tier)
- [ ] Admin access to both HubSpot and Salesforce

### Step-by-Step Connection

**Method 1: Native Integration**
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Search for Salesforce
3. Click **Connect** and authorize
4. Configure sync options, including object mapping and field synchronization

**Method 2: Via Zapier/Make**
If native integration is limited:
1. Create a new Zap/Scenario
2. Set HubSpot as trigger (e.g., new contact created)
3. Set Salesforce as action (e.g., create new contact)
4. Map fields accordingly, including email, phone number, and company name

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Lead Tracking
| Trigger | Action | Result |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| New form submission in HubSpot | Create new lead in Salesforce | Automated lead tracking and assignment |

### Workflow 2: Reverse Sync
Salesforce opportunities can be synced back to HubSpot, enabling marketing teams to track sales pipeline progress and analyze campaign ROI.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- **"Authentication Failed":** Reauthorize with fresh tokens
- **"Rate Limited":** Reduce sync frequency to every 15 minutes
- **"Missing Fields":** Check required field mapping, including custom fields

## Pro Tips
> **Power User Tip:** Set up error notifications in Slack so you know immediately when sync breaks, and configure custom alerts for specific error types.

## Limitations to Know
- Custom objects in Salesforce may not sync with HubSpot
- Rate limits apply to both HubSpot (100 requests/minute) and Salesforce (1,000 API calls/day)
- Feature gaps exist between HubSpot's Marketing Hub and Sales Hub tiers, affecting available integration features

## FAQ
Q: Does this work with the free tier of HubSpot?
A: No, the integration requires at least the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub tier.

Q: How often does data sync?
A: Data syncs in real-time for most objects, but some objects (e.g., custom objects) may require scheduled sync.

Q: Can I sync historical data?
A: Yes, HubSpot and Salesforce support backfilling historical data, but this may require additional configuration and API calls.
