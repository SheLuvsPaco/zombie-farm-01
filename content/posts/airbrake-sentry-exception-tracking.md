## Real-World Use Case: Exception Tracking
Let's consider a scenario where a 20-person e-commerce company using Shopify needs to track exceptions and errors in their application. With Airbrake, setup takes around 2 hours, and ongoing maintenance burden is relatively low. The cost breakdown for 100 users and 1,000 actions per month would be around $49 per month. However, with Sentry, setup takes around 4 hours, and ongoing maintenance burden is moderate. The cost breakdown for 100 users and 1,000 actions per month would be around $153 per month. A common gotcha with both tools is the need to configure error filtering and grouping rules to avoid noise and ensure relevant errors are tracked.
